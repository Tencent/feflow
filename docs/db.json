看成是一个核心和一大堆插件组成的生态。\n\n## 开发一个 Feflow 插件\n\n**开发一个 Feflow 插件非常简单，并且任何程序都能成为 Feflow 插件。**\n\n开发一个 Feflow 插件意味着给 Feflow 增加命令，\b例如你可以给 Feflow 增加一个 `add` 命令，让 Feflow 实现一个加法运算：\n\n```sh\nfeflow add 1 2 3\n# 输出 6\n```\n\n接下来，让我们就用这个例子来讲解一下如何开发一个 Feflow 插件。\n\n## 创建项目\n\n创建一个名为 `feflow-plugin-example` 的文件夹，并用 `npm init` 命令将它初始化。\n\n**注意，所有 Feflow 插件的项目目录名都必须以 `feflow-plugin-` 开头，并且项目内的 `package.json` 文件中的 `name` 字段必须和项目目录名保持一致。**\n\n## 编写逻辑\n\n新建一个 `index.js` 文件，\b实现加法运算逻辑，这时候暂时先无需考虑和 Feflow 插件相关的事情，只需要专注于你的逻辑：\n\n```js\n/**\n * 加法运算器\n * @param  {Array} args 一些需要累加的数字\n * @return {number} 累加的和\n */\nfunction add (args) {\n    const sum = args.reduce((sum, item) => {\n        return sum + item\n    }, 0)\n\n    console.log(sum)\n    return sum\n}\n```\n\n## 注册命令\n\n加法逻辑写好了，现在需要实现的就是将这个程序变成 Feflow 插件，即注册一个 `add` 命令到 Feflow：\n\n```js\nfeflow.cmd.register('add', '加法运算器', function(args) {\n    // args 是 add 后面的参数，已被 minimist 库解析\n    // 例如 `feflow add 1 2 3`，args 就是 { _: [1, 2, 3] }，\n    // 再比如 `feflow add -x 1 -y 2 --z-value 3 4 5 6`，args 就是 { _: [ 4, 5, 6 ], x: 1, y: 2, 'z-value': 3 }\n    // 调用主要的逻辑\n    add(args._);\n});\n```\n\n你无需担心 `feflow` \b没有声明或者没有任何模块的引用，Feflow 在使用这个插件的时候，会自动将 `feflow` 变量注入到**入口文件**（由  `package.json` 中的 `main` 字段决定，这里是 `index.js`）的全局作用域中。\n\n`feflow.cmd.register` 函数接收三个参数：\n\n* 第一个是想要给 Feflow 增加的命令名称\n* 第二个是对这个命令的描述说明信息（会在 feflow --help 中显示出来）\n* 第三个是新增\b的命令对应的执行函数。\n\n执行函数中，Feflow 会传递一个参数 args，它是一个对象，包含着 Feflow 运行该命令时所有在该命令后的参数。例如，运行 `feflow add 1 2 3` 时，args 就是 { _: [1, 2, 3] }。\n\n## 插件调试\n\n截至目前，你已经完成了一个插件，完整的代码可参考[这里](https://github.com/feflow/feflow-plugin-example/tree/e21b0b5c5f5b860e78e5d914f4ce4ccf366eee8d)。\b你可能迫不及待想试试。别急，让我们一步一步来。\n\n1. 运行 `npm link` 将插件项目链接到 NPM 全局。\n1. 运行 `cd ~/.feflow` 进入到 Feflow 主目录下。\n1. 运行 `npm link feflow-plugin-example` 将插件安装在 Feflow 主目录下。\n1. 编辑 `~/.feflow/package.json` 文件（可用 `vi ~/.feflow/package.json` 编辑），在 `dependencies` 字段中添加一行 `\"feflow-plugin-example\": \"1.0.0\"`。\n1. 运行 `feflow add 1 2 3` 启用插件。\n\n## 插件发布\n\n插件开发完毕后，接下来就可以发布插件了，\b你可以发布到 NPM 上，也可以发布到私有 NPM 仓库里。如果发布到私有仓库，可能需要配置一下 Feflow \b下载包的 `register` 和 `proxy`，配置方式参考[插件](./base-plugins-inner#全局配置插件)。\n\n发布完之后，你就可以通过\b `feflow install` 命令安装插件。\n\n## 插件上下文\n\n虽然你的插件已经可以用了，但是有些细节还能在优化一下。\n\n`feflow` 这个全局变量还提供了许多其他功能，这些功能让你的插件与 Feflow 结合的更紧密。\b我们把 `feflow` 这个全局变量称为插件上下文。它可以访问到 Feflow 实例上的所有属性。\n\n还是以 `feflow-plugin-example` 为例，在 `add` 函数中，我们用了一个 `console.log` 打印出运算结果，如果你致力于将\b插件打造成优秀的体验，你可以使用 `feflow.log.info` 来代替它。插件上下文提供了一个符合 Feflow 控制台输出规范的 API，这将保持插件与 Feflow 一致性的体验：\n\n```\nconst log = feflow.log;\nlog.info()    // 提示日志，控制台显示 `Feflow INFO [打印内容]`，`Feflow INFO` 为绿色文字。\nlog.debug()   // 调试日志，需要在命令行增加 --debug 才可启用这个方法，控制台显示 `Feflow DEBUG [打印内容]`，`Feflow DEBUG` 为灰色文字。\nlog.warn()    // 警告日志，控制台显示 `Feflow WARN [打印内容]`，`Feflow WARN` 被黄色背景填充。\nlog.error()   // 错误日志，控制台显示 `Feflow ERROR [打印内容]`，`Feflow ERROR` 被红色背景填充。\nlog.fatal()   // 致命错误日志，控制台显示 `Feflow FATAL [打印内容]`，`Feflow FATAL` 被红色背景填充。\n```\n\n更多属性和方法可参照 [插件上下文 API](./advance-plugin-context.html)\n\n### 非入口文件使用插件上下文\n\n上面的例子中，我们\b可以直接在 `index.js` 入口文件中使用插件上下文，但如果在非入口文件直接这么使用的话，会报错，所以得通过模块之间传参传过去。\n\n举个例子，现在我们再新建一个 `add.js` 文件，将 `index.js` 文件中的 `add` 函数移过去，`add.js` 和 `index.js` 就变成了下面这样：\n\n```js\n// add.js\n// 整个模块接收一个插件上下文参数\nmodule.exports = function add (feflow) {\n    // 原函数逻辑\n    return function (args) {\n        const sum = args.reduce((sum, item) => {\n            return sum + item\n        }, 0)\n\n        feflow.log.info(sum)\n        return sum\n    }\n}\n\n// index.js\n// 通过模块传参将插件上下文传递过去\nconst add = require('./add')(feflow)\n// 注册一个 add 命令\nfeflow.cmd.register('add', '加法运算器', function(args) {\n    add(args._);\n});\n```\n\n模块化后的完整代码可以参考[这里](https://github.com/feflow/feflow-plugin-example/tree/36127e14a6bc7ea0cd696a35f4b59255349d19bc)\n\n## 注册多个命令\n\n一个插件可以支持多个命令，所以我们不妨将 `feflow-plugin-example` 做的完善些，让它支持加减乘除四则运算。\n\n最后，你可以在[这里](https://github.com/feflow/feflow-plugin-example) 看到我们最终的插件。\n","source":"zh-cn/docs/advance-plugins-custom.md","raw":"title: 自定义插件\n---\n\nFeflow 之所以强大离不开它的插件设计，你可以把

1 2 3\n# 输出 6\n```\n\n接下来，让我们就用这个例子来讲解一下如何开发一个 Feflow 插件。\n\n## 创建项目\n\n创建一个名为 `feflow-plugin-example` 的文件夹，并用 `npm init` 命令将它初始化。\n\n**注意，所有 Feflow 插件的项目目录名都必须以 `feflow-plugin-` 开头，并且项目内的 `package.json` 文件中的 `name` 字段必须和项目目录名保持一致。**\n\n## 编写逻辑\n\n新建一个 `index.js` 文件，\b实现加法运算逻辑，这时候暂时先无需考虑和 Feflow 插件相关的事情，只需要专注于你的逻辑：\n\n```js\n/**\n * 加法运算器\n * @param  {Array} args 一些需要累加的数字\n * @return {number} 累加的和\n */\nfunction add (args) {\n    const sum = args.reduce((sum, item) => {\n        return sum + item\n    }, 0)\n\n    console.log(sum)\n    return sum\n}\n```\n\n## 注册命令\n\n加法逻辑写好了，现在需要实现的就是将这个程序变成 Feflow 插件，即注册一个 `add` 命令到 Feflow：\n\n```js\nfeflow.cmd.register('add', '加法运算器', function(args) {\n    // args 是 add 后面的参数，已被 minimist 库解析\n    // 例如 `feflow add 1 2 3`，args 就是 { _: [1, 2, 3] }，\n    // 再比如 `feflow add -x 1 -y 2 --z-value 3 4 5 6`，args 就是 { _: [ 4, 5, 6 ], x: 1, y: 2, 'z-value': 3 }\n    // 调用主要的逻辑\n    add(args._);\n});\n```\n\n你无需担心 `feflow` \b没有声明或者没有任何模块的引用，Feflow 在使用这个插件的时候，会自动将 `feflow` 变量注入到**入口文件**（由  `package.json` 中的 `main` 字段决定，这里是 `index.js`）的全局作用域中。\n\n`feflow.cmd.register` 函数接收三个参数：\n\n* 第一个是想要给 Feflow 增加的命令名称\n* 第二个是对这个命令的描述说明信息（会在 feflow --help 中显示出来）\n* 第三个是新增\b的命令对应的执行函数。\n\n执行函数中，Feflow 会传递一个参数 args，它是一个对象，包含着 Feflow 运行该命令时所有在该命令后的参数。例如，运行 `feflow add 1 2 3` 时，args 就是 { _: [1, 2, 3] }。\n\n## 插件调试\n\n截至目前，你已经完成了一个插件，完整的代码可参考[这里](https://github.com/feflow/feflow-plugin-example/tree/e21b0b5c5f5b860e78e5d914f4ce4ccf366eee8d)。\b你可能迫不及待想试试。别急，让我们一步一步来。\n\n1. 运行 `npm link` 将插件项目链接到 NPM 全局。\n1. 运行 `cd ~/.feflow` 进入到 Feflow 主目录下。\n1. 运行 `npm link feflow-plugin-example` 将插件安装在 Feflow 主目录下。\n1. 编辑 `~/.feflow/package.json` 文件（可用 `vi ~/.feflow/package.json` 编辑），在 `dependencies` 字段中添加一行 `\"feflow-plugin-example\": \"1.0.0\"`。\n1. 运行 `feflow add 1 2 3` 启用插件。\n\n## 插件发布\n\n插件开发完毕后，接下来就可以发布插件了，\b你可以发布到 NPM 上，也可以发布到私有 NPM 仓库里。如果发布到私有仓库，可能需要配置一下 Feflow \b下载包的 `register` 和 `proxy`，配置方式参考[插件](./base-plugins-inner#全局配置插件)。\n\n发布完之后，你就可以通过\b `feflow install` 命令安装插件。\n\n## 插件上下文\n\n虽然你的插件已经可以用了，但是有些细节还能在优化一下。\n\n`feflow` 这个全局变量还提供了许多其他功能，这些功能让你的插件与 Feflow 结合的更紧密。\b我们把 `feflow` 这个全局变量称为插件上下文。它可以访问到 Feflow 实例上的所有属性。\n\n还是以 `feflow-plugin-example` 为例，在 `add` 函数中，我们用了一个 `console.log` 打印出运算结果，如果你致力于将\b插件打造成优秀的体验，你可以使用 `feflow.log.info` 来代替它。插件上下文提供了一个符合 Feflow 控制台输出规范的 API，这将保持插件与 Feflow 一致性的体验：\n\n```\nconst log = feflow.log;\nlog.info()    // 提示日志，控制台显示 `Feflow INFO [打印内容]`，`Feflow INFO` 为绿色文字。\nlog.debug()   // 调试日志，需要在命令行增加 --debug 才可启用这个方法，控制台显示 `Feflow DEBUG [打印内容]`，`Feflow DEBUG` 为灰色文字。\nlog.warn()    // 警告日志，控制台显示 `Feflow WARN [打印内容]`，`Feflow WARN` 被黄色背景填充。\nlog.error()   // 错误日志，控制台显示 `Feflow ERROR [打印内容]`，`Feflow ERROR` 被红色背景填充。\nlog.fatal()   // 致命错误日志，控制台显示 `Feflow FATAL [打印内容]`，`Feflow FATAL` 被红色背景填充。\n```\n\n更多属性和方法可参照 [插件上下文 API](./advance-plugin-context.html)\n\n### 非入口文件使用插件上下文\n\n上面的例子中，我们\b可以直接在 `index.js` 入口文件中使用插件上下文，但如果在非入口文件直接这么使用的话，会报错，所以得通过模块之间传参传过去。\n\n举个例子，现在我们再新建一个 `add.js` 文件，将 `index.js` 文件中的 `add` 函数移过去，`add.js` 和 `index.js` 就变成了下面这样：\n\n```js\n// add.js\n// 整个模块接收一个插件上下文参数\nmodule.exports = function add (feflow) {\n    // 原函数逻辑\n    return function (args) {\n        const sum = args.reduce((sum, item) => {\n            return sum + item\n        }, 0)\n\n        feflow.log.info(sum)\n        return sum\n    }\n}\n\n// index.js\n// 通过模块传参将插件上下文传递过去\nconst add = require('./add')(feflow)\n// 注册一个 add 命令\nfeflow.cmd.register('add', '加法运算器', function(args) {\n    add(args._);\n});\n```\n\n模块化后的完整代码可以参考[这里](https://github.com/feflow/feflow-plugin-example/tree/36127e14a6bc7ea0cd696a35f4b59255349d19bc)\n\n## 注册多个命令\n\n一个插件可以支持多个命令，所以我们不妨将 `feflow-plugin-example` 做的完善些，让它支持加减乘除四则运算。\n\n最后，你可以在[这里](https://github.com/feflow/feflow-plugin-example)

之所以强大离不开它的插件设计，你可以把 Feflow 看成是一个核心和一大堆插件组成的生态。</p>\n<h2 id=\"开发一个-Feflow-插件\"><a href=\"#开发一个-Feflow-插件\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"开发一个 Feflow 插件\"></a>开发一个 Feflow 插件</h2><p><strong>开发一个 Feflow 插件非常简单，并且任何程序都能成为 Feflow 插件。</strong></p>\n<p>开发一个 Feflow 插件意味着给 Feflow 增加命令，\b例如你可以给 Feflow 增加一个 <code>add</code> 命令，让 Feflow 实现一个加法运算：</p>\n<figure class=\"highlight sh\"><table><tr><td class=\"code\"><pre><span class=\"line\">feflow add 1 2 3</span><br><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"comment\"># 输出 6</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>\n<p>接下来，让我们就用这个例子来讲解一下如何开发一个 Feflow 插件。</p>\n<h2 id=\"创建项目\"><a href=\"#创建项目\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"创建项目\"></a>创建项目</h2><p>创建一个名为 <code>feflow-plugin-example</code> 的文件夹，并用 <code>npm init</code> 命令将它初始化。</p>\n<p><strong>注意，所有 Feflow 插件的项目目录名都必须以 <code>feflow-plugin-</code> 开头，并且项目内的 <code>package.json</code> 文件中的 <code>name</code> 字段必须和项目目录名保持一致。</strong></p>\n<h2 id=\"编写逻辑\"><a href=\"#编写逻辑\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"编写逻辑\"></a>编写逻辑</h2><p>新建一个 <code>index.js</code> 文件，\b实现加法运算逻辑，这时候暂时先无需考虑和 Feflow 插件相关的事情，只需要专注于你的逻辑：</p>\n<figure class=\"highlight js\"><table><tr><td

&#125;</span></span><br><span class=\"line\">    <span class=\"comment\">// 调用主要的逻辑</span></span><br><span class=\"line\">    add(args._);</span><br><span class=\"line\">&#125;);</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>\n<p>你无需担心 <code>feflow</code> \b没有声明或者没有任何模块的引用，Feflow 在使用这个插件的时候，会自动将 <code>feflow</code> 变量注入到<strong>入口文件</strong>（由  <code>package.json</code> 中的 <code>main</code> 字段决定，这里是 <code>index.js</code>）的全局作用域中。</p>\n<p><code>feflow.cmd.register</code> 函数接收三个参数：</p>\n<ul>\n<li>第一个是想要给 Feflow 增加的命令名称</li>\n<li>第二个是对这个命令的描述说明信息（会在 feflow –help 中显示出来）</li>\n<li>第三个是新增\b的命令对应的执行函数。</li>\n</ul>\n<p>执行函数中，Feflow 会传递一个参数 args，它是一个对象，包含着 Feflow 运行该命令时所有在该命令后的参数。例如，运行 <code>feflow add 1 2 3</code> 时，args 就是 { _: [1, 2, 3] }。</p>\n<h2 id=\"插件调试\"><a href=\"#插件调试\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"插件调试\"></a>插件调试</h2><p>截至目前，你已经完成了一个插件，完整的代码可参考<a

link</code> 将插件项目链接到 NPM 全局。</li>\n<li>运行 <code>cd ~/.feflow</code> 进入到 Feflow 主目录下。</li>\n<li>运行 <code>npm link feflow-plugin-example</code> 将插件安装在 Feflow 主目录下。</li>\n<li>编辑 <code>~/.feflow/package.json</code> 文件（可用 <code>vi ~/.feflow/package.json</code> 编辑），在 <code>dependencies</code> 字段中添加一行 <code>&quot;feflow-plugin-example&quot;: &quot;1.0.0&quot;</code>。</li>\n<li>运行 <code>feflow add 1 2 3</code> 启用插件。</li>\n</ol>\n<h2 id=\"插件发布\"><a href=\"#插件发布\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"插件发布\"></a>插件发布</h2><p>插件开发完毕后，接下来就可以发布插件了，\b你可以发布到 NPM 上，也可以发布到私有 NPM 仓库里。如果发布到私有仓库，可能需要配置一下 Feflow \b下载包的 <code>register</code> 和 <code>proxy</code>，配置方式参考<a href=\"./base-plugins-inner#全局配置插件\">插件</a>。</p>\n<p>发布完之后，你就可以通过\b <code>feflow install</code> 命令安装插件。</p>\n<h2 id=\"插件上下文\"><a href=\"#插件上下文\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"插件上下文\"></a>插件上下文</h2><p>虽然你的插件已经可以用了，但是有些细节还能在优化一下。</p>\n<p><code>feflow</code> 这个全局变量还提供了许多其他功能，这些功能让你的插件与 Feflow 结合的更紧密。\b我们把 <code>feflow</code> 这个全局变量称为插件上下文。它可以访问到 Feflow 实例上的所有属性。</p>\n<p>还是以 <code>feflow-plugin-example</code> 为例，在 <code>add</code> 函数中，我们用了一个 <code>console.log</code> 打印出运算结果，如果你致力于将\b插件打造成优秀的体验，你可以使用 <code>feflow.log.info</code> 来代替它。插件上下文提供了一个符合 Feflow 控制台输出规范的 API，这将保持插件与 Feflow 一致性的体验：</p>\n<figure class=\"highlight plain\"><table><tr><td class=\"code\"><pre><span class=\"line\">const log = feflow.log;</span><br><span class=\"line\">log.info()    // 提示日志，控制台显示 `Feflow INFO [打印内容]`，`Feflow INFO` 为绿色文字。</span><br><span

href=\"#非入口文件使用插件上下文\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"非入口文件使用插件上下文\"></a>非入口文件使用插件上下文</h3><p>上面的例子中，我们\b可以直接在 <code>index.js</code> 入口文件中使用插件上下文，但如果在非入口文件直接这么使用的话，会报错，所以得通过模块之间传参传过去。</p>\n<p>举个例子，现在我们再新建一个 <code>add.js</code> 文件，将 <code>index.js</code> 文件中的 <code>add</code> 函数移过去，<code>add.js</code> 和 <code>index.js</code>

的内置插件会调用一个脚手架来创建项目。那么，如何创建一个自己的脚手架呢？\n\n其实不难，我们充分利用了社区的力量，只要你的脚手架是一个 Yeoman 脚手架即可。如果你会开发 Yeoman 脚手架，那么你已经基本能够开发一个自己的脚手架了；如果你不会，文章后面的部分也会简单地讲解一下。\n\n## 开发一个 Yeoman 脚手架\n\n如果你已经会开发一个 Yeoman 脚手架了，可以跳过这个章节。但要注意以下要点：\n\n* 脚手架项目下 `package.json` 文件的 `description` 字段不能为空。因为在用户选择脚手架时，Feflow 需要用这个字段来提供脚手架说明。\n\n如果你没有 Yeoman 脚手架的开发经验，那也别急，\b接下来会给一个入门指导，更详细的开发文档请阅读[官方文档](https://yeoman.io/authoring/)。\n\n### 准备工作\n\n全局安装 `yo` 和 `generator-generator`：\n\n```sh\nnpm install yo generator-generator -g\n# or yarn global add yo generator-generator\n```\n\n这里借助了 Yeoman 以及他们写的脚手架生成器，目的是为了快速让大家创建出自己的脚手架。这不是必须选项，但在本教程中最好是按这个步骤来，否则下面可能没法继续。\n\n### 生成脚手架模版\n\n现在，只需一行命令即可生成一个脚手架模版：\n\n```sh\nyo generator\n```\n\n再次强调，**生成过程中询问的 `Description` 一定要填写**，Feflow 会使用它来提供脚手架说明。\n\n你可能会注意到，**生成出来的脚手架模版的项目名是以 `generator-` 开头的**，如果你自己手动创建一个脚手架，这也是必须的。\n\n让我们来看一下生成的脚手架模版的主要目录结构：\n\n```sh\n├── generators/\n|   └── app/\n│       ├── index.js\n│       └── templates/\n│           └── dummyfile.txt\n```\n\n其中，`generators/app/index.js` 文件就是脚手架生成项目的逻辑，而 `generators/templates/` 文件夹就是一个项目模版。后面我们主要就是在这两个地方做定制，改造出自己的脚手架。\n\n### 创建自己的脚手架\n\n#### 项目模版\n\n对于团队来说，一般都会有自己的项目目录结构规范，或者是有现成的项目模版，那要转换成 Yeoman 脚手架的项目模版就很简单了，直接找个项目或者把项目模版复制粘贴到 `generators/templates/` 文件夹下即可。但是要接入 Feflow 还需要做些工作。\n\n对于个人或者还没有项目模版的团队来说，首要任务当然是规划好自己的项目模版了。在本文示例中，我们将创建一个非常简单的、支持 React 的项目模版。\n\n##### 创建模版\n\n我们的模版主要的目录结构如下：\n\n```sh\n|- src # 示例源码\n    |- index.html # HTML 入口\n    |- index.js # JS 入口，也是 Webpack 打包的入口\n|- _babelrc # 处理 JSX 的配置\n|- feflow.json # 这个文件是必须的，作为项目和 Feflow 的桥梁\n```\n\n其中，如果项目中含有 `.babelrc` 这样的文件，推荐在模版中将 `.` 换成 `_`，写成 `_babelrc` 这样的形式。\n\n另外，`feflow.json` 是必须的配置文件，Feflow 会读取其中的构建器配置来对 src 中的源码进行打包构建。\n\n这里要说明一下，Feflow 定义了一个构建器的概念，实际上它指的就是把构建的代码抽离出项目形成的 NPM 包。这样做的好处在于，团队内部的项目遇到构建工具升级的时候，无需对每个项目都进行一遍升级，只需要升级构建器并更改项目中 `feflow.json` 中的配置即可。其他的好处例如节省本地空间、节省项目安装依赖包的时间、统一构建规范等等。\n\n下面是我们这个项目示例的 `feflow.json` 的配置：\n\n```json\n{\n    // builderType 指明了构建器的名称\n    \"builderType\": \"builder-feflow-example\",\n    \"builderOptions\": {\n        // 你可以在这里加入自定义构建器构建流程的配置项，例如是否需要压缩 HTML 等\n    }\n}\n```\n\n> 构建器 builder-feflow-example 只适用于本教程示例脚手架生成的项目，其他脚手架生成的项目需要适配构建器，关于构建器的开发请阅读 [自定义构建器](./advance-builder-custom.html) 这一章。\n\n##### 动态模版内容\n\n如果你想在你的项目模版中加入动态的内容，例如根据询问用户得到的答案来填充项目名称，你就可以在项目模版下的 `package.json` 中这样写：\n\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"<%= name %>\"\n}\n```\n\nYeoman 模版支持 <%= *variable* > 这样的语法来填充动态内容，其中的 *variable* 是如何传进来将会在后面看到。\n\n### 项目生成逻辑\n\n有了项目模版之后，我们还缺少根据项目模版创建一个项目的逻辑。最简单逻辑就是复制一份模版到\b当前目录下，当然，高级点的脚手架一般都会有如下过程：\n\n1. 询问并接收用户的输入；\n1. 执行一些\b自定义的脚本；\n1. 根据用户输入和脚本执行的结果渲染项目模版，并\b生成于当前目录下。 \n\n上述的这些逻辑统统都写在 `generators/app/index.js` 文件中。通常来说，这个文件\b都满足如下格式：\n\n```js\nconst Generator = require('yeoman-generator');\n\nmodule.exports = class extends Generator {\n    // 初始化阶段\n    initializing () { /* code */ },\n    // 接收用户输入阶段\n    prompting () { /* code */ },\n    // 保存配置信息和文件\n    configuring () { /* code */ },\n    // 执行自定义函数阶段\n    default () { /* code */ },\n    // 生成项目目录阶段\n    writing () { /* code */ },\n    // 统一处理冲突，如要生成的文件已经存在是否覆盖等处理\n    conflicts () { /* code */ },\n    // 安装依赖阶段\n    install () { /* code */ },\n    // 结束阶段\n    end () { /* code */ }\n}\n```\n\nYeoman 提供了一个基础的生成器类 `Generator`，我们基于它扩展自己的生成逻辑。`Generator` 类定义了八个生命周期，它们会按上述代码的顺序依次执行。\n\n示例脚手架的生成逻辑可[阅读这里](https://github.com/feflow/generator-feflow-example/blob/master/generators/app/index.js)\n\n### 调试\n\n现在，你的脚手架就定制好了，让我们来试一试吧。先安装在 Feflow 主目录下：\n\n```sh\ncd <your-path>/generator-startkit-demo\nnpm link\ncd ~/.feflow\nnpm link generator-startkit-demo\n```\n\n然后再编辑 `~/.feflow/package.json` 文件（可用 `vi ~/.feflow/package.json` 编辑），在 `dependencies` 字段中添加一行 `\"generator-startkit-demo\": \"1.0.0\"`（版本号随意）。目的是为了让 Feflow 找到你的脚手架。\n\n现在，可以在你想创建项目的位置运行 `feflow init` 了。你会看到你的脚手架被展示出来了，选择它，就能开始项目的创建了。\n\n> `generator-feflow-example` 的源码地址是 https://github.com/feflow/generator-feflow-example\n\n## 更成熟的方案\n\n上述的例子，仅仅是为了简单才这样设计，满足不了生产环境的使用，如果你想看更成熟的脚手架方案，我们现在就有，建议去看看：\n\n*

脚手架的开发经验，那也别急，\b接下来会给一个入门指导，更详细的开发文档请阅读[官方文档](https://yeoman.io/authoring/)。\n\n### 准备工作\n\n全局安装 `yo` 和 `generator-generator`：\n\n```sh\nnpm install yo generator-generator -g\n# or yarn global add yo generator-generator\n```\n\n这里借助了 Yeoman 以及他们写的脚手架生成器，目的是为了快速让大家创建出自己的脚手架。这不是必须选项，但在本教程中最好是按这个步骤来，否则下面可能没法继续。\n\n### 生成脚手架模版\n\n现在，只需一行命令即可生成一个脚手架模版：\n\n```sh\nyo generator\n```\n\n再次强调，**生成过程中询问的 `Description` 一定要填写**，Feflow 会使用它来提供脚手架说明。\n\n你可能会注意到，**生成出来的脚手架模版的项目名是以 `generator-` 开头的**，如果你自己手动创建一个脚手架，这也是必须的。\n\n让我们来看一下生成的脚手架模版的主要目录结构：\n\n```sh\n├── generators/\n|   └── app/\n│       ├── index.js\n│       └── templates/\n│           └── dummyfile.txt\n```\n\n其中，`generators/app/index.js` 文件就是脚手架生成项目的逻辑，而 `generators/templates/` 文件夹就是一个项目模版。后面我们主要就是在这两个地方做定制，改造出自己的脚手架。\n\n### 创建自己的脚手架\n\n#### 项目模版\n\n对于团队来说，一般都会有自己的项目目录结构规范，或者是有现成的项目模版，那要转换成 Yeoman 脚手架的项目模版就很简单了，直接找个项目或者把项目模版复制粘贴到 `generators/templates/` 文件夹下即可。但是要接入 Feflow 还需要做些工作。\n\n对于个人或者还没有项目模版的团队来说，首要任务当然是规划好自己的项目模版了。在本文示例中，我们将创建一个非常简单的、支持 React 的项目模版。\n\n##### 创建模版\n\n我们的模版主要的目录结构如下：\n\n```sh\n|- src # 示例源码\n    |- index.html # HTML 入口\n    |- index.js # JS 入口，也是 Webpack 打包的入口\n|- _babelrc # 处理 JSX 的配置\n|- feflow.json # 这个文件是必须的，作为项目和 Feflow 的桥梁\n```\n\n其中，如果项目中含有 `.babelrc` 这样的文件，推荐在模版中将 `.` 换成 `_`，写成 `_babelrc` 这样的形式。\n\n另外，`feflow.json` 是必须的配置文件，Feflow 会读取其中的构建器配置来对 src 中的源码进行打包构建。\n\n这里要说明一下，Feflow 定义了一个构建器的概念，实际上它指的就是把构建的代码抽离出项目形成的 NPM 包。这样做的好处在于，团队内部的项目遇到构建工具升级的时候，无需对每个项目都进行一遍升级，只需要升级构建器并更改项目中 `feflow.json` 中的配置即可。其他的好处例如节省本地空间、节省项目安装依赖包的时间、统一构建规范等等。\n\n下面是我们这个项目示例的 `feflow.json` 的配置：\n\n```json\n{\n    // builderType 指明了构建器的名称\n    \"builderType\": \"builder-feflow-example\",\n    \"builderOptions\": {\n        // 你可以在这里加入自定义构建器构建流程的配置项，例如是否需要压缩 HTML 等\n    }\n}\n```\n\n> 构建器 builder-feflow-example 只适用于本教程示例脚手架生成的项目，其他脚手架生成的项目需要适配构建器，关于构建器的开发请阅读 [自定义构建器](./advance-builder-custom.html) 这一章。\n\n##### 动态模版内容\n\n如果你想在你的项目模版中加入动态的内容，例如根据询问用户得到的答案来填充项目名称，你就可以在项目模版下的 `package.json` 中这样写：\n\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"<%= name %>\"\n}\n```\n\nYeoman 模版支持 <%= *variable* > 这样的语法来填充动态内容，其中的 *variable* 是如何传进来将会在后面看到。\n\n### 项目生成逻辑\n\n有了项目模版之后，我们还缺少根据项目模版创建一个项目的逻辑。最简单逻辑就是复制一份模版到\b当前目录下，当然，高级点的脚手架一般都会有如下过程：\n\n1. 询问并接收用户的输入；\n1. 执行一些\b自定义的脚本；\n1. 根据用户输入和脚本执行的结果渲染项目模版，并\b生成于当前目录下。 \n\n上述的这些逻辑统统都写在 `generators/app/index.js` 文件中。通常来说，这个文件\b都满足如下格式：\n\n```js\nconst Generator = require('yeoman-generator');\n\nmodule.exports = class extends Generator {\n    // 初始化阶段\n    initializing () { /* code */ },\n    // 接收用户输入阶段\n    prompting () { /* code */ },\n    // 保存配置信息和文件\n    configuring () { /* code */ },\n    // 执行自定义函数阶段\n    default () { /* code */ },\n    // 生成项目目录阶段\n    writing () { /* code */ },\n    // 统一处理冲突，如要生成的文件已经存在是否覆盖等处理\n    conflicts () { /* code */ },\n    // 安装依赖阶段\n    install () { /* code */ },\n    // 结束阶段\n    end () { /* code */ }\n}\n```\n\nYeoman 提供了一个基础的生成器类 `Generator`，我们基于它扩展自己的生成逻辑。`Generator` 类定义了八个生命周期，它们会按上述代码的顺序依次执行。\n\n示例脚手架的生成逻辑可[阅读这里](https://github.com/feflow/generator-feflow-example/blob/master/generators/app/index.js)\n\n### 调试\n\n现在，你的脚手架就定制好了，让我们来试一试吧。先安装在 Feflow 主目录下：\n\n```sh\ncd <your-path>/generator-startkit-demo\nnpm link\ncd ~/.feflow\nnpm link generator-startkit-demo\n```\n\n然后再编辑 `~/.feflow/package.json` 文件（可用 `vi ~/.feflow/package.json` 编辑），在 `dependencies` 字段中添加一行 `\"generator-startkit-demo\": \"1.0.0\"`（版本号随意）。目的是为了让 Feflow 找到你的脚手架。\n\n现在，可以在你想创建项目的位置运行 `feflow init` 了。你会看到你的脚手架被展示出来了，选择它，就能开始项目的创建了。\n\n> `generator-feflow-example` 的源码地址是 https://github.com/feflow/generator-feflow-example\n\n## 更成熟的方案\n\n上述的例子，仅仅是为了简单才这样设计，满足不了生产环境的使用，如果你想看更成熟的脚手架方案，我们现在就有，建议去看看：\n\n*

init</code> 的时候，Feflow 的内置插件会调用一个脚手架来创建项目。那么，如何创建一个自己的脚手架呢？</p>\n<p>其实不难，我们充分利用了社区的力量，只要你的脚手架是一个 Yeoman 脚手架即可。如果你会开发 Yeoman 脚手架，那么你已经基本能够开发一个自己的脚手架了；如果你不会，文章后面的部分也会简单地讲解一下。</p>\n<h2 id=\"开发一个-Yeoman-脚手架\"><a href=\"#开发一个-Yeoman-脚手架\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"开发一个 Yeoman 脚手架\"></a>开发一个 Yeoman 脚手架</h2><p>如果你已经会开发一个 Yeoman 脚手架了，可以跳过这个章节。但要注意以下要点：</p>\n<ul>\n<li>脚手架项目下 <code>package.json</code> 文件的 <code>description</code> 字段不能为空。因为在用户选择脚手架时，Feflow 需要用这个字段来提供脚手架说明。</li>\n</ul>\n<p>如果你没有 Yeoman 脚手架的开发经验，那也别急，\b接下来会给一个入门指导，更详细的开发文档请阅读<a href=\"https://yeoman.io/authoring/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">官方文档</a>。</p>\n<h3 id=\"准备工作\"><a href=\"#准备工作\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"准备工作\"></a>准备工作</h3><p>全局安装 <code>yo</code> 和 <code>generator-generator</code>：</p>\n<figure class=\"highlight sh\"><table><tr><td class=\"code\"><pre><span class=\"line\">npm install yo generator-generator -g</span><br><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"comment\"># or yarn global add yo generator-generator</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>\n<p>这里借助了 Yeoman 以及他们写的脚手架生成器，目的是为了快速让大家创建出自己的脚手架。这不是必须选项，但在本教程中最好是按这个步骤来，否则下面可能没法继续。</p>\n<h3 id=\"生成脚手架模版\"><a href=\"#生成脚手架模版\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"生成脚手架模版\"></a>生成脚手架模版</h3><p>现在，只需一行命令即可生成一个脚手架模版：</p>\n<figure class=\"highlight sh\"><table><tr><td class=\"code\"><pre><span class=\"line\">yo generator</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>\n<p>再次强调，<strong>生成过程中询问的 <code>Description</code> 一定要填写</strong>，Feflow 会使用它来提供脚手架说明。</p>\n<p>你可能会注意到，<strong>生成出来的脚手架模版的项目名是以 <code>generator-</code> 开头的</strong>，如果你自己手动创建一个脚手架，这也是必须的。</p>\n<p>让我们来看一下生成的脚手架模版的主要目录结构：</p>\n<figure class=\"highlight sh\"><table><tr><td class=\"code\"><pre><span class=\"line\">├── generators/</span><br><span class=\"line\">|   └── app/</span><br><span class=\"line\">│       ├── index.js</span><br><span class=\"line\">│       └── templates/</span><br><span class=\"line\">│           └── dummyfile.txt</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>\n<p>其中，<code>generators/app/index.js</code> 文件就是脚手架生成项目的逻辑，而 <code>generators/templates/</code> 文件夹就是一个项目模版。后面我们主要就是在这两个地方做定制，改造出自己的脚手架。</p>\n<h3 id=\"创建自己的脚手架\"><a href=\"#创建自己的脚手架\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"创建自己的脚手架\"></a>创建自己的脚手架</h3><h4 id=\"项目模版\"><a href=\"#项目模版\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"项目模版\"></a>项目模版</h4><p>对于团队来说，一般都会有自己的项目目录结构规范，或者是有现成的项目模版，那要转换成 Yeoman 脚手架的项目模版就很简单了，直接找个项目或者把项目模版复制粘贴到 <code>generators/templates/</code> 文件夹下即可。但是要接入 Feflow 还需要做些工作。</p>\n<p>对于个人或者还没有项目模版的团队来说，首要任务当然是规划好自己的项目模版了。在本文示例中，我们将创建一个非常简单的、支持 React 的项目模版。</p>\n<h5 id=\"创建模版\"><a href=\"#创建模版\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"创建模版\"></a>创建模版</h5><p>我们的模版主要的目录结构如下：</p>\n<figure class=\"highlight sh\"><table><tr><td class=\"code\"><pre><span class=\"line\">|- src <span class=\"comment\"># 示例源码</span></span><br><span class=\"line\">    |- index.html <span class=\"comment\"># HTML 入口</span></span><br><span class=\"line\">    |- index.js <span class=\"comment\"># JS 入口，也是 Webpack 打包的入口</span></span><br><span class=\"line\">|- _babelrc <span class=\"comment\"># 处理 JSX 的配置</span></span><br><span class=\"line\">|- feflow.json <span class=\"comment\"># 这个文件是必须的，作为项目和 Feflow 的桥梁</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>\n<p>其中，如果项目中含有 <code>.babelrc</code> 这样的文件，推荐在模版中将 <code>.</code> 换成 <code>_</code>，写成 <code>_babelrc</code> 这样的形式。</p>\n<p>另外，<code>feflow.json</code> 是必须的配置文件，Feflow 会读取其中的构建器配置来对 src 中的源码进行打包构建。</p>\n<p>这里要说明一下，Feflow 定义了一个构建器的概念，实际上它指的就是把构建的代码抽离出项目形成的 NPM 包。这样做的好处在于，团队内部的项目遇到构建工具升级的时候，无需对每个项目都进行一遍升级，只需要升级构建器并更改项目中 <code>feflow.json</code> 中的配置即可。其他的好处例如节省本地空间、节省项目安装依赖包的时间、统一构建规范等等。</p>\n<p>下面是我们这个项目示例的 <code>feflow.json</code> 的配置：</p>\n<figure class=\"highlight\"><table><tr><td class=\"code\"><pre><span class=\"line\">&#123;</span><br><span class=\"line\">    // builderType 指明了构建器的名称</span><br><span class=\"line\">    \"builderType\": \"builder-feflow-example\",</span><br><span class=\"line\">    \"builderOptions\": &#123;</span><br><span class=\"line\">        // 你可以在这里加入自定义构建器构建流程的配置项，例如是否需要压缩 HTML 等</span><br><span class=\"line\">    &#125;</span><br><span class=\"line\">&#125;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>\n<blockquote>\n<p>构建器 builder-feflow-example 只适用于本教程示例脚手架生成的项目，其他脚手架生成的项目需要适配构建器，关于构建器的开发请阅读 <a href=\"./advance-builder-custom.html\">自定义构建器</a> 这一章。</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h5 id=\"动态模版内容\"><a href=\"#动态模版内容\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"动态模版内容\"></a>动态模版内容</h5><p>如果你想在你的项目模版中加入动态的内容，例如根据询问用户得到的答案来填充项目名称，你就可以在项目模版下的 <code>package.json</code> 中这样写：</p>\n<figure class=\"highlight json\"><table><tr><td class=\"code\"><pre><span class=\"line\">&#123;</span><br><span class=\"line\">  <span class=\"attr\">\"name\"</span>: <span class=\"string\">\"&lt;%= name %&gt;\"</span></span><br><span class=\"line\">&#125;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>\n<p>Yeoman 模版支持 &lt;%= <em>variable</em> &gt; 这样的语法来填充动态内容，其中的 <em>variable</em> 是如何传进来将会在后面看到。</p>\n<h3 id=\"项目生成逻辑\"><a href=\"#项目生成逻辑\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"项目生成逻辑\"></a>项目生成逻辑</h3><p>有了项目模版之后，我们还缺少根据项目模版创建一个项目的逻辑。最简单逻辑就是复制一份模版到\b当前目录下，当然，高级点的脚手架一般都会有如下过程：</p>\n<ol>\n<li>询问并接收用户的输入；</li>\n<li>执行一些\b自定义的脚本；</li>\n<li>根据用户输入和脚本执行的结果渲染项目模版，并\b生成于当前目录下。 </li>\n</ol>\n<p>上述的这些逻辑统统都写在 <code>generators/app/index.js</code> 文件中。通常来说，这个文件\b都满足如下格式：</p>\n<figure class=\"highlight js\"><table><tr><td class=\"code\"><pre><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"keyword\">const</span> Generator = <span class=\"built_in\">require</span>(<span class=\"string\">'yeoman-generator'</span>);</span><br><span class=\"line\"></span><br><span

class=\"line\">&#125;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>\n<p>Yeoman 提供了一个基础的生成器类 <code>Generator</code>，我们基于它扩展自己的生成逻辑。<code>Generator</code> 类定义了八个生命周期，它们会按上述代码的顺序依次执行。</p>\n<p>示例脚手架的生成逻辑可<a href=\"https://github.com/feflow/generator-feflow-example/blob/master/generators/app/index.js\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">阅读这里</a></p>\n<h3 id=\"调试\"><a href=\"#调试\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"调试\"></a>调试</h3><p>现在，你的脚手架就定制好了，让我们来试一试吧。先安装在 Feflow 主目录下：</p>\n<figure class=\"highlight sh\"><table><tr><td class=\"code\"><pre><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"built_in\">cd</span> &lt;your-path&gt;/generator-startkit-demo</span><br><span class=\"line\">npm link</span><br><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"built_in\">cd</span> ~/.feflow</span><br><span class=\"line\">npm link generator-startkit-demo</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>\n<p>然后再编辑 <code>~/.feflow/package.json</code> 文件（可用 <code>vi ~/.feflow/package.json</code> 编辑），在 <code>dependencies</code> 字段中添加一行 <code>&quot;generator-startkit-demo&quot;: &quot;1.0.0&quot;</code>（版本号随意）。目的是为了让 Feflow 找到你的脚手架。</p>\n<p>现在，可以在你想创建项目的位置运行 <code>feflow init</code> 了。你会看到你的脚手架被展示出来了，选择它，就能开始项目的创建了。</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><code>generator-feflow-example</code> 的源码地址是 <a href=\"https://github.com/feflow/generator-feflow-example\" target=\"_blank\"

就支持很多命令了。\n\n现在，就让我们来一览 Feflow 所有的内置插件以及他们注册的命令。\n\n## 模块管理插件\n\n该插件包含两个命令：\n\n```sh\n# 1. 安装包\nfeflow install <package-name>\n# 2. 卸载包\nfeflow uninstall <package-name>\n```\n\n`feflow install <package-name>` 命令是迄今为止用的最多的命令之一，它可以将各种 NPM 模块安装至 `~/.feflow/node_modules` 下面。我们用它安装脚手架、构建器或者是插件。\n\n`feflow uninstall <package-name>` 命令与上述命令相反，它用于卸载 Feflow 下的 NPM 模块。\n\n由于这个插件可以安装或卸载任意 NPM 模块，所以我们称之为模块管理插件。有了这个插件，就方便了诸如脚手架、构建器、部署器、插件的管理。\n\n## 脚手架调度插件\n\n该插件包含一个命令：\n\n```sh\nfeflow init\n```\n\n这个插件可以让用户从本地已经安装好的脚手架中选取一个用作项目的创建，因此我们把这个插件称为脚手架调度插件。\n\n脚手架调度插件每次执行的时候，会自动更新本地所有有新版本的脚手架，如果你想跳过更新，可以加上一个 `--disableCheck` 的参数：\n\n```sh\nfeflow init --disableCheck\n```\n\n> 关于脚手架的开发可以阅读[这里](./advance-scaffold-custom.html)\n\n## 构建器调度插件\n\n该插件包含两个命令：\n\n```sh\n# 1. 本地开发\nfeflow dev\n# 2. 生成打包文件\nfeflow build\n```\n\n这个插件会获取项目根目录下 `feflow.js` 或者 `feflow.json` 配置文件中的 `builderType` 字段的值作为构建器的名字。如果你没有用 Feflow 安装过这个构建器，该插件则会自动帮你安装好，然后这个插件会委托构建器执行 `dev` 或者是 `build` 命令，实现构建过程。\n\n因为构建器是独立的，这个插件会根据配置选择指定的构建器进行构建，所以我们把这个插件称为构建器调度插件。这种将构建器分离出来的方式有效的帮助了项目升级构建代码的过程。\n\n> 关于构建器的开发可以阅读[这里](./advance-builder-custom.html)\n\n## 部署器调度插件\n\n该插件包含一个命令：\n\n```\nfeflow deploy\n```\n\n这个插件会获取项目根目录下 `feflow.js` 或者 `feflow.json` 配置文件中的 `deployerType` 字段的值作为部署器的名字，然后委托部署器执行 `deploy` 命令，实现部署过程。\n\n> 关于部署器的开发可以阅读[这里](./deployer-custom.html)\n\n## 全局配置插件\n\n这个插件可能一般用的比较少，它是用来在 ~/.feflow/.feflowrc.yml 文件中设置和获取配置项的，这个文件可以作为 Feflow 全局的配置文件使用。Feflow 内置插件会用到该文件中的两个配置项，一个是 `registry`，一个是 `proxy`，都是用于 Feflow 或插件下载包时需要走私有的仓库或者代理的情况。如果你自己开发了插件，并且想给用户一些自定义的配置，就可以利用该插件来添加这些配置，然后你的插件可以通过 Feflow 传过来的上下文获取到这些配置。\n\n全局配置插件注册了一个 `config` 命令，并且支持 `set`、`get`、`list` 三个子命令，用法如下：\n\n```sh\n# 列出所有配置项\nfeflow config list\n# 获取一个配置项\nfeflow config get <key>\n# 添加或修改一个配置项\nfeflow config set <key> <value>\n```\n\n## 代码检查插件\n\nFeflow 还内置了一个代码检查插件，可以方便你用 ESLint 检查项目的代码：\n\n```sh\nfeflow lint [folder]\n```\n\n它还支持 `--ignore` 参数，允许检查时忽略一些目录或文件。\n\n## 自定义插件\n\nFeflow 除了内置一些核心插件外，还支持开发者编写自己的插件并注册到 Feflow 上，将 Feflow 打造成自己独有的一套工程化工具，关于如何开发一个自己的插件请阅读[自定义插件](./advance-plugins-custom.html)一章。","source":"zh-cn/docs/base-plugins-inner.md","raw":"title: 插件\n---\n\n目前为止，你可能接触到了 Feflow 的一些命令，现在，我要揭开它们的真面目，即它们都是 Feflow

class=\"comment\"># 1. 安装包</span></span><br><span class=\"line\">feflow install &lt;package-name&gt;</span><br><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"comment\"># 2. 卸载包</span></span><br><span class=\"line\">feflow uninstall &lt;package-name&gt;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>\n<p><code>feflow install &lt;package-name&gt;</code> 命令是迄今为止用的最多的命令之一，它可以将各种 NPM 模块安装至 <code>~/.feflow/node_modules</code> 下面。我们用它安装脚手架、构建器或者是插件。</p>\n<p><code>feflow uninstall &lt;package-name&gt;</code> 命令与上述命令相反，它用于卸载 Feflow 下的 NPM 模块。</p>\n<p>由于这个插件可以安装或卸载任意 NPM 模块，所以我们称之为模块管理插件。有了这个插件，就方便了诸如脚手架、构建器、部署器、插件的管理。</p>\n<h2 id=\"脚手架调度插件\"><a href=\"#脚手架调度插件\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"脚手架调度插件\"></a>脚手架调度插件</h2><p>该插件包含一个命令：</p>\n<figure class=\"highlight sh\"><table><tr><td class=\"code\"><pre><span class=\"line\">feflow init</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>\n<p>这个插件可以让用户从本地已经安装好的脚手架中选取一个用作项目的创建，因此我们把这个插件称为脚手架调度插件。</p>\n<p>脚手架调度插件每次执行的时候，会自动更新本地所有有新版本的脚手架，如果你想跳过更新，可以加上一个 <code>--disableCheck</code> 的参数：</p>\n<figure class=\"highlight sh\"><table><tr><td class=\"code\"><pre><span class=\"line\">feflow init --disableCheck</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>\n<blockquote>\n<p>关于脚手架的开发可以阅读<a href=\"./advance-scaffold-custom.html\">这里</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"构建器调度插件\"><a href=\"#构建器调度插件\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"构建器调度插件\"></a>构建器调度插件</h2><p>该插件包含两个命令：</p>\n<figure class=\"highlight sh\"><table><tr><td class=\"code\"><pre><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"comment\"># 1. 本地开发</span></span><br><span class=\"line\">feflow dev</span><br><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"comment\"># 2. 生成打包文件</span></span><br><span class=\"line\">feflow build</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>\n<p>这个插件会获取项目根目录下 <code>feflow.js</code> 或者 <code>feflow.json</code> 配置文件中的 <code>builderType</code> 字段的值作为构建器的名字。如果你没有用 Feflow 安装过这个构建器，该插件则会自动帮你安装好，然后这个插件会委托构建器执行 <code>dev</code> 或者是 <code>build</code> 命令，实现构建过程。</p>\n<p>因为构建器是独立的，这个插件会根据配置选择指定的构建器进行构建，所以我们把这个插件称为构建器调度插件。这种将构建器分离出来的方式有效的帮助了项目升级构建代码的过程。</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>关于构建器的开发可以阅读<a href=\"./advance-builder-custom.html\">这里</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"部署器调度插件\"><a href=\"#部署器调度插件\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"部署器调度插件\"></a>部署器调度插件</h2><p>该插件包含一个命令：</p>\n<figure class=\"highlight plain\"><table><tr><td class=\"code\"><pre><span class=\"line\">feflow deploy</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>\n<p>这个插件会获取项目根目录下 <code>feflow.js</code> 或者 <code>feflow.json</code> 配置文件中的 <code>deployerType</code> 字段的值作为部署器的名字，然后委托部署器执行 <code>deploy</code> 命令，实现部署过程。</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>关于部署器的开发可以阅读<a href=\"./deployer-custom.html\">这里</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"全局配置插件\"><a href=\"#全局配置插件\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"全局配置插件\"></a>全局配置插件</h2><p>这个插件可能一般用的比较少，它是用来在 ~/.feflow/.feflowrc.yml 文件中设置和获取配置项的，这个文件可以作为 Feflow 全局的配置文件使用。Feflow 内置插件会用到该文件中的两个配置项，一个是 <code>registry</code>，一个是 <code>proxy</code>，都是用于 Feflow 或插件下载包时需要走私有的仓库或者代理的情况。如果你自己开发了插件，并且想给用户一些自定义的配置，就可以利用该插件来添加这些配置，然后你的插件可以通过 Feflow 传过来的上下文获取到这些配置。</p>\n<p>全局配置插件注册了一个 <code>config</code> 命令，并且支持 <code>set</code>、<code>get</code>、<code>list</code> 三个子命令，用法如下：</p>\n<figure class=\"highlight sh\"><table><tr><td class=\"code\"><pre><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"comment\"># 列出所有配置项</span></span><br><span class=\"line\">feflow config list</span><br><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"comment\"># 获取一个配置项</span></span><br><span class=\"line\">feflow config get &lt;key&gt;</span><br><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"comment\"># 添加或修改一个配置项</span></span><br><span class=\"line\">feflow config <span class=\"built_in\">set</span> &lt;key&gt; &lt;value&gt;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>\n<h2 id=\"代码检查插件\"><a href=\"#代码检查插件\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"代码检查插件\"></a>代码检查插件</h2><p>Feflow 还内置了一个代码检查插件，可以方便你用 ESLint 检查项目的代码：</p>\n<figure class=\"highlight sh\"><table><tr><td class=\"code\"><pre><span class=\"line\">feflow lint [folder]</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>\n<p>它还支持 <code>--ignore</code> 参数，允许检查时忽略一些目录或文件。</p>\n<h2 id=\"自定义插件\"><a href=\"#自定义插件\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"自定义插件\"></a>自定义插件</h2><p>Feflow 除了内置一些核心插件外，还支持开发者编写自己的插件并注册到 Feflow 上，将 Feflow 打造成自己独有的一套工程化工具，关于如何开发一个自己的插件请阅读<a

的一些命令，现在，我要揭开它们的真面目，即它们都是 Feflow 内置插件注册的命令。</p>\n<p>插件是 Feflow 的一个重要特性，本质上 Feflow 就是一个插件管理工具，每个插件可以在 Feflow 上注册多个命令，这样一来，Feflow 就支持很多命令了。</p>\n<p>现在，就让我们来一览 Feflow 所有的内置插件以及他们注册的命令。</p>\n<h2 id=\"模块管理插件\"><a href=\"#模块管理插件\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"模块管理插件\"></a>模块管理插件</h2><p>该插件包含两个命令：</p>\n<figure class=\"highlight sh\"><table><tr><td class=\"code\"><pre><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"comment\"># 1. 安装包</span></span><br><span class=\"line\">feflow install &lt;package-name&gt;</span><br><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"comment\"># 2. 卸载包</span></span><br><span class=\"line\">feflow uninstall &lt;package-name&gt;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>\n<p><code>feflow install &lt;package-name&gt;</code> 命令是迄今为止用的最多的命令之一，它可以将各种 NPM 模块安装至 <code>~/.feflow/node_modules</code> 下面。我们用它安装脚手架、构建器或者是插件。</p>\n<p><code>feflow uninstall &lt;package-name&gt;</code> 命令与上述命令相反，它用于卸载 Feflow 下的 NPM 模块。</p>\n<p>由于这个插件可以安装或卸载任意 NPM 模块，所以我们称之为模块管理插件。有了这个插件，就方便了诸如脚手架、构建器、部署器、插件的管理。</p>\n<h2 id=\"脚手架调度插件\"><a href=\"#脚手架调度插件\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"脚手架调度插件\"></a>脚手架调度插件</h2><p>该插件包含一个命令：</p>\n<figure class=\"highlight sh\"><table><tr><td class=\"code\"><pre><span class=\"line\">feflow init</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>\n<p>这个插件可以让用户从本地已经安装好的脚手架中选取一个用作项目的创建，因此我们把这个插件称为脚手架调度插件。</p>\n<p>脚手架调度插件每次执行的时候，会自动更新本地所有有新版本的脚手架，如果你想跳过更新，可以加上一个 <code>--disableCheck</code> 的参数：</p>\n<figure class=\"highlight sh\"><table><tr><td class=\"code\"><pre><span class=\"line\">feflow init --disableCheck</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>\n<blockquote>\n<p>关于脚手架的开发可以阅读<a href=\"./advance-scaffold-custom.html\">这里</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"构建器调度插件\"><a href=\"#构建器调度插件\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"构建器调度插件\"></a>构建器调度插件</h2><p>该插件包含两个命令：</p>\n<figure class=\"highlight sh\"><table><tr><td class=\"code\"><pre><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"comment\"># 1. 本地开发</span></span><br><span class=\"line\">feflow dev</span><br><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"comment\"># 2. 生成打包文件</span></span><br><span class=\"line\">feflow build</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>\n<p>这个插件会获取项目根目录下 <code>feflow.js</code> 或者 <code>feflow.json</code> 配置文件中的 <code>builderType</code> 字段的值作为构建器的名字。如果你没有用 Feflow 安装过这个构建器，该插件则会自动帮你安装好，然后这个插件会委托构建器执行 <code>dev</code> 或者是 <code>build</code> 命令，实现构建过程。</p>\n<p>因为构建器是独立的，这个插件会根据配置选择指定的构建器进行构建，所以我们把这个插件称为构建器调度插件。这种将构建器分离出来的方式有效的帮助了项目升级构建代码的过程。</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>关于构建器的开发可以阅读<a href=\"./advance-builder-custom.html\">这里</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"部署器调度插件\"><a href=\"#部署器调度插件\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"部署器调度插件\"></a>部署器调度插件</h2><p>该插件包含一个命令：</p>\n<figure class=\"highlight plain\"><table><tr><td class=\"code\"><pre><span class=\"line\">feflow deploy</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>\n<p>这个插件会获取项目根目录下 <code>feflow.js</code> 或者 <code>feflow.json</code> 配置文件中的 <code>deployerType</code> 字段的值作为部署器的名字，然后委托部署器执行 <code>deploy</code> 命令，实现部署过程。</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>关于部署器的开发可以阅读<a href=\"./deployer-custom.html\">这里</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"全局配置插件\"><a href=\"#全局配置插件\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"全局配置插件\"></a>全局配置插件</h2><p>这个插件可能一般用的比较少，它是用来在 ~/.feflow/.feflowrc.yml 文件中设置和获取配置项的，这个文件可以作为 Feflow 全局的配置文件使用。Feflow 内置插件会用到该文件中的两个配置项，一个是 <code>registry</code>，一个是 <code>proxy</code>，都是用于 Feflow 或插件下载包时需要走私有的仓库或者代理的情况。如果你自己开发了插件，并且想给用户一些自定义的配置，就可以利用该插件来添加这些配置，然后你的插件可以通过 Feflow 传过来的上下文获取到这些配置。</p>\n<p>全局配置插件注册了一个 <code>config</code> 命令，并且支持 <code>set</code>、<code>get</code>、<code>list</code> 三个子命令，用法如下：</p>\n<figure class=\"highlight sh\"><table><tr><td class=\"code\"><pre><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"comment\"># 列出所有配置项</span></span><br><span class=\"line\">feflow config list</span><br><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"comment\"># 获取一个配置项</span></span><br><span class=\"line\">feflow config get &lt;key&gt;</span><br><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"comment\"># 添加或修改一个配置项</span></span><br><span class=\"line\">feflow config <span class=\"built_in\">set</span> &lt;key&gt; &lt;value&gt;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>\n<h2 id=\"代码检查插件\"><a href=\"#代码检查插件\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"代码检查插件\"></a>代码检查插件</h2><p>Feflow 还内置了一个代码检查插件，可以方便你用 ESLint 检查项目的代码：</p>\n<figure class=\"highlight sh\"><table><tr><td class=\"code\"><pre><span class=\"line\">feflow lint [folder]</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>\n<p>它还支持 <code>--ignore</code> 参数，允许检查时忽略一些目录或文件。</p>\n<h2 id=\"自定义插件\"><a href=\"#自定义插件\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"自定义插件\"></a>自定义插件</h2><p>Feflow 除了内置一些核心插件外，还支持开发者编写自己的插件并注册到 Feflow 上，将 Feflow 打造成自己独有的一套工程化工具，关于如何开发一个自己的插件请阅读<a

npm proxy 要填写 <a href=\"http://r.tnpm.oa.com:80\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">http://r.tnpm.oa.com:80</a> ，这样一来，<code>Feflow</code>

是什么</h2><p>Feflow (读音 /ˈfefləʊ/)是腾讯开源的用于提升工程效率的<strong>前端工作流和规范工具</strong>。最新版本是v0.15.1，托管在Github上：<a href=\"https://github.com/feflow/feflow\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">feflow</a>。目前已经在NOW直播、花样直播、花样交友、手Q附近、群视频、群送礼、回音、应用宝、企鹅号等业务广泛使用。有80+ WEB/IOS/Andriod 稳定用户，累计投入生产项目达到240+。</p>\n<p>Feflow 借鉴了 Pipline 的思想，将日常的研发工作划分为：初始化、本地开发、打包构建、检查、发布上线五个步骤。分别对应 init、dev、build、test和deploy五个基本命令。</p>\n<p>除了服务好基本的开发工作流和规范，Feflow 提供了易于扩展的插件机制，用于打造团队统一的工具链生态。</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://qpic.url.cn/feeds_pic/ajNVdqHZLLD5vbArj0iaIkMLnGU3xPohibwRHibiaR3cibuy6RKYgHNCmFg/\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"概念\"><a href=\"#概念\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"概念\"></a>概念</h2><p>Feflow 只提供了一个CLI和内核，CLI 负责和命令行终端进行交互，内核则提供了更新机制、插件机制和标准化的日志输出能力，Feflow 自身并不会内置任何业务强相关的逻辑。</p>\n<p>因此，如果你想在团队中使用 Feflow，你需要了解以下概念：</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#脚手架\">脚手架</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#构建器\">构建器</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#插件\">插件</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#开发规范\">开发规范</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"脚手架\"><a href=\"#脚手架\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"脚手架\"></a>脚手架</h3><p>\b\b\b<br>\b在不少前端团队中，都存在<strong>项目开发不智能</strong>的问题。很多开发者开发新项目的时候都是基于原有项目拷贝的方式进行，\b这样就造成了一个团队中不同人开发的项目目录结构各不相同，\b后续项目交接和维护起来费时费力。</p>\n<p>为了解决这个问题，Feflow 引入了社区主流的脚手架\b进行项目的初始化。Feflow 的脚手架基于 <a href=\"https://yeoman.io/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Yeoman</a>, \b\b在它基础上进行扩展，会将标准化的日志、CLI工具函数通过上下文对象传递给脚手架；同时提供脚手架的增量更新机制，创建项目时，当本地版本和远程版本不兼容时会提升增量更新。</p>\n<p>引入了脚手架之后，一方面可以让团队保持统一的技术栈和统一目录结构；另一方面，还可以在项目初始化的时候做\b一些自动化的事情，比如自动创建远程Git仓库并且分配开发者 master/developer权限、申请监控Id、和内部的 CI/CD 系统快速打通等等一系列\b优势。</p>\n<h3 id=\"构建器\"><a href=\"#构建器\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"构建器\"></a>构建器</h3><p>\b项目创建好之后，接下来的问题就是本地开发和代码打包构建了。通常的做法是将构建脚本直接放在业务项目里面，每个业务开发者都可以根据自己的需求自行修改，这样导致的问题是每个项目的构建脚本都存在差异，构建不统一，同时每个项目\b都需要重复安装构建依赖。</p>\n<p>Feflow 引入了构建器这个概念，它的基本思想是将构建脚本进行统一管理，由团队里面\b熟悉构建的同学进行统一的维护。\b\b构建器需要发布到 npm 上进行版本管理，\b同时建议每个\b项目采用相同的\b构建器。构建器通过 feflow 安装后会存放在 <code>~/.feflow/node_modules</code>下，这样每个项目都可以共用一套构建脚本了。</p>\n<h3 id=\"插件\"><a href=\"#插件\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"插件\"></a>插件</h3><p>除了提供基础的功能之外，Feflow里面还通过一套插件机制去方便的扩展子命令。你可以利用插件去做很多自动化的事情，比如批量压缩图片、搭建运营活动本地开发SDK、代码统计功能等等。</p>\n<h2 id=\"贡献者\"><a href=\"#贡献者\"

Feflow，本文档将帮助您快速上手。如果您在使用过程中遇到问题，请在 <a href=\"https://github.com/feflow/feflow/issues\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">GitHub</a> 上反馈。</p>\n<p><img

是什么</h2><p>Feflow (读音 /ˈfefləʊ/)是腾讯开源的用于提升工程效率的<strong>前端工作流和规范工具</strong>。最新版本是v0.15.1，托管在Github上：<a href=\"https://github.com/feflow/feflow\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">feflow</a>。目前已经在NOW直播、花样直播、花样交友、手Q附近、群视频、群送礼、回音、应用宝、企鹅号等业务广泛使用。有80+ WEB/IOS/Andriod 稳定用户，累计投入生产项目达到240+。</p>\n<p>Feflow 借鉴了 Pipline 的思想，将日常的研发工作划分为：初始化、本地开发、打包构建、检查、发布上线五个步骤。分别对应 init、dev、build、test和deploy五个基本命令。</p>\n<p>除了服务好基本的开发工作流和规范，Feflow 提供了易于扩展的插件机制，用于打造团队统一的工具链生态。</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://qpic.url.cn/feeds_pic/ajNVdqHZLLD5vbArj0iaIkMLnGU3xPohibwRHibiaR3cibuy6RKYgHNCmFg/\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"概念\"><a href=\"#概念\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"概念\"></a>概念</h2><p>Feflow 只提供了一个CLI和内核，CLI 负责和命令行终端进行交互，内核则提供了更新机制、插件机制和标准化的日志输出能力，Feflow 自身并不会内置任何业务强相关的逻辑。</p>\n<p>因此，如果你想在团队中使用 Feflow，你需要了解以下概念：</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#脚手架\">脚手架</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#构建器\">构建器</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#插件\">插件</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#开发规范\">开发规范</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"脚手架\"><a href=\"#脚手架\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"脚手架\"></a>脚手架</h3><p>\b\b\b<br>\b在不少前端团队中，都存在<strong>项目开发不智能</strong>的问题。很多开发者开发新项目的时候都是基于原有项目拷贝的方式进行，\b这样就造成了一个团队中不同人开发的项目目录结构各不相同，\b后续项目交接和维护起来费时费力。</p>\n<p>为了解决这个问题，Feflow 引入了社区主流的脚手架\b进行项目的初始化。Feflow 的脚手架基于 <a href=\"https://yeoman.io/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Yeoman</a>, \b\b在它基础上进行扩展，会将标准化的日志、CLI工具函数通过上下文对象传递给脚手架；同时提供脚手架的增量更新机制，创建项目时，当本地版本和远程版本不兼容时会提升增量更新。</p>\n<p>引入了脚手架之后，一方面可以让团队保持统一的技术栈和统一目录结构；另一方面，还可以在项目初始化的时候做\b一些自动化的事情，比如自动创建远程Git仓库并且分配开发者 master/developer权限、申请监控Id、和内部的 CI/CD 系统快速打通等等一系列\b优势。</p>\n<h3 id=\"构建器\"><a href=\"#构建器\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"构建器\"></a>构建器</h3><p>\b项目创建好之后，接下来的问题就是本地开发和代码打包构建了。通常的做法是将构建脚本直接放在业务项目里面，每个业务开发者都可以根据自己的需求自行修改，这样导致的问题是每个项目的构建脚本都存在差异，构建不统一，同时每个项目\b都需要重复安装构建依赖。</p>\n<p>Feflow 引入了构建器这个概念，它的基本思想是将构建脚本进行统一管理，由团队里面\b熟悉构建的同学进行统一的维护。\b\b构建器需要发布到 npm 上进行版本管理，\b同时建议每个\b项目采用相同的\b构建器。构建器通过 feflow 安装后会存放在 <code>~/.feflow/node_modules</code>下，这样每个项目都可以共用一套构建脚本了。</p>\n<h3 id=\"插件\"><a href=\"#插件\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"插件\"></a>插件</h3><p>除了提供基础的功能之外，Feflow里面还通过一套插件机制去方便的扩展子命令。你可以利用插件去做很多自动化的事情，比如批量压缩图片、搭建运营活动本地开发SDK、代码统计功能等等。</p>\n<h2 id=\"贡献者\"><a href=\"#贡献者\"

为什么不直接使用airbnb团队的 eslint-config-airbnb？<br>A： airbnb官方的规则过于庞大，有10多个规则文件。维护起来成本较高，选择基于轻量级的 eslint:recommend 基础之上定制团队ESLint规则更加简单，也便于维护。</p>\n<p>Q： 我觉得eslint-config-ivweb有些规则不太合适，怎么办？<br>A： 欢迎提交issue讨论或者直接提交PR。仓库地址：<a href=\"https://github.com/feflow/eslint-config-ivweb\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://github.com/feflow/eslint-config-ivweb</a></p>\n<p>Q： 为什么使用lint-staged？<br>A： lint-staged只会对修改过的js文件行数进行代码规范检查，不会对所有的代码检查，更加合理和可操作。</p>\n","site":{"data":{"languages":{"zh-cn":{"name":"简体中文","disqus_lang":"zh"}},"encologies":[{"registry":"generator-ivweb","type":"inner"},{"registry":"builder-webpack4","type":"inner"},{"registry":"feflow-plugin-svgtocn","type":"inner"},{"registry":"@tencent/generator-halo-templates","type":"inner"},{"registry":"@tencent/feflow-plugin-pic-optimize","type":"inner"},{"registry":"@tencent/feflow-plugin-lego","type":"inner"},{"registry":"@tencent/feflow-plugin-paper-sync","type":"inner"},{"registry":"@tencent/generator-yybinit","type":"inner"},{"registry":"@tencent/builder-webpack3-x","type":"inner"},{"registry":"builder-webpack3","type":"inner"},{"registry":"@tencent/generator-ivweb-startkit","type":"inner"},{"registry":"@tencent/feflow-plugin-sourcemap-upload","type":"inner"}],"menu":{"docs":"/docs/","encologies":"/encologies/"},"sidebar":{"docs":{"base":{"base-overview":"index.html","base-install":"base-install.html","base-init":"base-init.html","base-develope":"base-develope.html","base-build":"base-build.html","base-plugins-inner":"base-plugins-inner.html"},"advance":{"advance-overview":"advance-overview.html","advance-scaffold-custom":"advance-scaffold-custom.html","advance-builder-custom":"advance-builder-custom.html","advance-plugins-custom":"advance-plugins-custom.html","advance-plugins-context":"advance-plugins-context.html"},"rule":{"rule-overview":"rule-overview.html","rule-git-commit":"rule-git-commit.html","rule-eslint":"rule-eslint.html"}}},"plugins":[{"name":"hexo-filter-mermaid-diagrams","description":"mermaid

项目代码太多，不影响历史代码。只针对有改动的代码（.js和.jsx后缀）才进行校验。</p>\n<p>第一步：添加或者修改.eslintrc.js 配置文件</p>\n<figure class=\"highlight javascript\"><table><tr><td class=\"code\"><pre><span class=\"line\"><span

放置在最后。部分eslint:recommend定义的规则有点严格，ivweb里面有做定制化的修改。</p>\n<p>第二步：增加precommit的hook和eslint-config-ivweb依赖</p>\n<p>此处我们使用husky来管理所有的Hook，同之前的commit message校验。</p>\n<figure class=\"highlight

为什么不直接使用airbnb团队的 eslint-config-airbnb？<br>A： airbnb官方的规则过于庞大，有10多个规则文件。维护起来成本较高，选择基于轻量级的 eslint:recommend 基础之上定制团队ESLint规则更加简单，也便于维护。</p>\n<p>Q： 我觉得eslint-config-ivweb有些规则不太合适，怎么办？<br>A：

尾部：如果需要的化可以添加一个链接到issue地址或者其它文档，或者关闭某个issue。\n```\n\n### Git分支与版本发布规范\n\n* 基本原则：master为保护分支，不直接在master上进行代码修改和提交。\n* 开发日常需求或者项目时，从master分支上checkout一个feature分支进行开发或者bugfix分支进行bug修复，功能测试完毕并且项目发布上线后，`将feature分支合并到主干master，并且打Tag发布，最后删除开发分支`。分支命名规范：\n    * 分支版本命名规则：分支类型 _ 分支发布时间 _ 分支功能。比如：feature_20170401_fairy_flower\n    * 分支类型包括：feature、 bugfix、refactor三种类型，即新功能开发、bug修复和代码重构\n    * 时间使用年月日进行命名，不足2位补0\n    * 分支功能命名使用snake case命名法，即下划线命名。\n* Tag包括3位版本，前缀使用v。比如v1.2.31。Tag命名规范：\n    * 新功能开发使用第2位版本号，bug修复使用第3位版本号\n    * 核心基础库或者Node中间价可以在大版本发布请使用灰度版本号，在版本后面加上后缀，用中划线分隔。alpha或者belta后面加上次数，即第几次alpha：\n        * v2.0.0-alpha.1 \n        * v2.0.0-belta.1\n* 版本正式发布前需要生成changelog文档，然后再发布上线。\n\n### 如何接入？\n\n接入参考[git-commit-style-guide](https://github.com/feflow/git-commit-style-guide)项目。具体步骤如下：\n\n* 第一步：在工程跟目录下的package.json文件加入如下代码所示的scripts和dependencies内容，版本号为3位版本号。\n\n```sh\n  {\n    \"name\": \"application-name\",\n    \"version\": \"0.1.0\",\n    \"scripts\": {\n      \"commitmsg\": \"validate-commit-msg\",\n      \"commit\": \"git-cz \",\n      \"changelog\": \"conventional-changelog -p angular -i CHANGELOG.md -s -r 0\"\n    },\n    \"devDependencies\": {\n      \"commitizen\": \"^2.3.0\",\n      \"validate-commit-msg\": \"^2.11.1\",\n      \"conventional-changelog-cli\": \"^1.2.0\",\n      \"husky\": \"^0.13.1\"\n    }\n  }\n```\n\n* 第二步：在工程根目录新建.vcmrc文件，并且文件内容为\n\n```sh\n{\n  \"helpMessage\": \"\\nPlease fix your commit message (and consider using https://www.npmjs.com/package/commitizen)\\n\",\n  \"types\": [\n    \"feat\",\n    \"fix\",\n    \"docs\",\n    \"style\",\n    \"refactor\",\n    \"perf\",\n    \"test\",\n    \"chore\",\n    \"revert\"\n  ],\n  \"warnOnFail\": false,\n  \"autoFix\": false\n}\n```\n\n### 接入后的Git commit操作流程\n\n* 第一步：创建一个feature分支或者bugfix分支\n\n```sh\n  $ git checkout -b feature_infinite_load    # 切换到一个feature分支或者bug fix分支\n```\n\n* 第二步：将代码提交到本地Git仓库，并填写符合要求的Commit message格式\n\n```sh\n  $ git add .\n  $ git commit                               # 此处不要加任何参数，比如-m\n```\n\n  如下图所示：\n\n![](http://images2015.cnblogs.com/blog/1030776/201703/1030776-20170304153136563-2126734467.png)\n\n\n\n* 第三步：将代码同步到远程Git仓库\n\n```sh\n  $ git push origin feature_infinite_load    # 将修改发布到远程仓库 \n```\n\n* 第四步：自动生成changelog，并打Tag发布\n\n```sh\n  $ tnpm run changelog                    # 使用npm script中的changlog命令直接从git元数据生成日志。\n  $ git tag v0.1.0\n  $ git push origin

class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Git分支与版本发布规范\"></a>Git分支与版本发布规范</h3><ul>\n<li>基本原则：master为保护分支，不直接在master上进行代码修改和提交。</li>\n<li>开发日常需求或者项目时，从master分支上checkout一个feature分支进行开发或者bugfix分支进行bug修复，功能测试完毕并且项目发布上线后，<code>将feature分支合并到主干master，并且打Tag发布，最后删除开发分支</code>。分支命名规范：<ul>\n<li>分支版本命名规则：分支类型 _ 分支发布时间 _ 分支功能。比如：feature_20170401_fairy_flower</li>\n<li>分支类型包括：feature、 bugfix、refactor三种类型，即新功能开发、bug修复和代码重构</li>\n<li>时间使用年月日进行命名，不足2位补0</li>\n<li>分支功能命名使用snake case命名法，即下划线命名。</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Tag包括3位版本，前缀使用v。比如v1.2.31。Tag命名规范：<ul>\n<li>新功能开发使用第2位版本号，bug修复使用第3位版本号</li>\n<li>核心基础库或者Node中间价可以在大版本发布请使用灰度版本号，在版本后面加上后缀，用中划线分隔。alpha或者belta后面加上次数，即第几次alpha：<ul>\n<li>v2.0.0-alpha.1 </li>\n<li>v2.0.0-belta.1</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>版本正式发布前需要生成changelog文档，然后再发布上线。</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"如何接入？\"><a href=\"#如何接入？\" class=\"headerlink\"

是一个前端工程化工具，它能轻易地帮你完成从项目创建、开发、构建到发布的所有流程，这么说可能还是不明白，下面让我们通过几分钟的例子来亲自感受一下。\n\n## 安装 Feflow\n\n\b`Feflow` 支持 Node 6.0 以上的版本，你可以使用以下命令来安装：\n\n```sh\nnpm i feflow-cli -g\n# or `yarn global add feflow-cli`\n```\n\n如果你是第一次安装，那么需要运行一次 `Feflow` 来初始化：\n\n```sh\nfeflow\n```\n\n这时你会看到如下界面：\n\n![Feflow初始化](https://qpic.url.cn/feeds_pic/ajNVdqHZLLBnQ35KoavYEVib5rbiahTaHy5yk9XoTAauib7EYVzbD4zlw/)\n\n这里让你填写的 npm registry 和 npm proxy 是为了让你用 `Feflow` 安装插件的时候保证网络畅通。比如说如果你的插件是在 tnpm 上，那么这里的 npm registry 要填写 http://r.tnpm.oa.com，而 npm proxy 要填写 http://r.tnpm.oa.com:80，这样一来，`Feflow` 在安装插件时，就会通过这个配置进行包的下载。\n\n如果你不小心一路回车使用了默认配置，但是你的插件的私有仓库里，那么你还可以通过以下命令来配置。以 tpm 为例：\n\n```sh\nfeflow config set registry http://r.tnpm.oa.com\nfeflow config set proxy http://r.tnpm.oa.com:80\n```\n\n> 关于 feflow config 命令的详解可以看[这里](.)\n\n为了继续本教程，请务必配置执行上述命令哦。\n\n## 安装脚手架\n\n`Feflow` 的核心部分并没有一个脚手架，脚手架都是通过插件的形式来安装的。为了简单起见，你可以先使用我们团队提供的脚手架 `[generator-now-webpack]((https://git.code.oa.com/feflow-plugin/generator-now-webpack)` 来继续这个教程。可以用如下命令安装：\n\n```sh\nfeflow install @tencent/generator-now-webpack\n```\n\n> 关于脚手架详细内容可以看[这里](.)\n\n到这里，脚手架就安装成功了，下面就可以开始创建项目了。\n\n## 创建项目\n\n> 官方教程假设你已经知道如何打开终端或者 cmd.exe，并且知道 shell 的一些初级知识，例如命令、环境变量等，以及已经在电脑上安装好了 Node v8.0 以上的版本。\n\n你可以直接运行以下命令开始项目的创建：\n\n```sh\nfeflow init\n```\n\n执行命令后，就会让你选择脚手架了。\n\n### 选择脚手架\n\n![脚手架选择](https://qpic.url.cn/feeds_pic/Q3auHgzwzM7gVx6mBUxNNFeUGVZI0RzI7hcn2za3VW7ia9B1oP2L7OQ/)\n\nFeflow 会让你从现有的脚手架中选择一个来创建项目，\b\b目前你只安装一个脚手架，所以只用选择 `基于 React + Redux + Webpack 的 web 业务开发解决方案` 就好。它是一个多页面脚手架，用它创建的项目自带 `React` 和 `Redux` 库，且使用 `Webpack` 作为构建工具。\n\n> 关于官方推荐的脚手架的详细介绍可参考[此文档](.)\n\n### 创建远程仓库\n\n选择完脚手架后，紧接着你又看到如下界面：\n\n![Git仓库创建](https://qpic.url.cn/feeds_pic/PiajxSqBRaEJyqw9knm4CLEQ4QRRbjFQZic6MXthn1acIt8Bvf0EJeDw/)\n\n是的，你没有看错，你无需在 `工蜂（git.code.oa.com）` 中创建一个仓库然后再与本地仓库关联起来，这个过程 `Feflow` 会自动帮你完成。当然，如果你已经在 `工蜂（git.code.oa.com）` 中创建了一个仓库并且克隆到了本地，你可以在这里输入 `n` 并按下回车。本教程假设你并没有一个仓库\b，所以你需要在这里输入 `y`。\n\n接下来，`Feflow` 会让你输入项目名称：\n\n![项目名称](https://qpic.url.cn/feeds_pic/PiajxSqBRaEJCIiad6HuhWfgkc9DpRnK7h95uf1hhRJicIHchdyibHwfXg/)\n\n每个团队的项目名称都需要一个规范，这样一眼就能从名称看出这是属于哪个业务、哪个平台的项目，方便项目归类和管理。但是，通常这个规范往往难以记住，特别是团队如果有新人来的时候，根本不知道有这个规范。\b`Feflow` 通过在创建项目的时候给予提示来解决这个问题。\n\n\b如上图所示，`Feflow` 团队的项目名称规范是 `业务类别-项目类型-项目名字`，你可以参考，也可以输入其他你想输入的项目名称。\n\n### 项目描述、版本号\n\b\b输完\b项目名称之后，`Feflow` 还会让你输入\b项目描述和版本号，项目描述尽可能写详细，让团队其他成员能够知道这个项目是干什么的，版本号尽可能合理，最好有团队自己的版本规范。\n\n### 接入 BadJS\n\n接下来，`Feflow` 会让你选择是否需要接入 `BadJS`。`BadJS` 是我们团队监控项目质量的系统，你可以通过它定位到项目的报错，这里推荐使用：\n\n![BadJS选择](https://qpic.url.cn/feeds_pic/PiajxSqBRaEJDTcTrNglmJFaXXtCDLlgGq6UZJTf7jrtAmIbRBQM3hA/)\n\n一旦你确认选择之后，`Feflow` 会自动去申请 `BadJS ID`，并填充到生成的项目里面，这样一来，就省去了人工的步骤，同时又让项目有了质量保障。\n\n> 关于如何使用 `BadJS` 来管理项目的质量请看[这篇文章](.)\n\n### \b申请离线包 ID\n\n让我们继续走下去，下一步 `Feflow` 会让你选择是否自动申请离线包 ID：\n\n![离线包选择](https://qpic.url.cn/feeds_pic/ajNVdqHZLLCKwy1cT4Tr3Z1wovA8Vzh2qATlnCHmEsGNX3Qpo89Y9w/)\n\n> 离线包是我们团队提高页面加载速度的\b\b\b方案之一，简单地来说，它会将 `HTML`、`JS`、`CSS` 等静态文件存储在用户的设备上，下次打开页面时，会直接读取\b设备上的资源。当然，如果页面有更新，那么新的离线包会被下载下来，等到用户下次进页面时，就会启用新的离线包。而离线包 ID 则是离线包的唯一标识，能让页面下载指定的离线包。\n>\n> 关于离线包的详情可参考[这篇文章](.)\n\n如果你考虑在项目中使用我们的离线包方案，那么就需要确认选择该项，这样的话 `Feflow` 就会自动\b申请 `离线包 ID` 并填充到生成的项目中，让页面有了使用离线包的能力。\n\n### 申请 `Monitor id`\n\n接下来，`Feflow` 会让你选择\b自动申请 `Monitor id`：\n\n![MonitorId选择](https://qpic.url.cn/feeds_pic/ajNVdqHZLLBGx7WlUpaTpjSmwUqzPXgnWV7saiaTWjApBicTMBcxe2mg/)\n\n> Monitor 是我们团队的数据监控系统，\b像页面PV、接口异常等都会上报到该系统，然后你就能在该系统上看到这些数据有多大的量，可以帮助发现\b业务的异常，也可以帮助知道业务的\b各种指标等。而一个 `Monitor id` 就对应着一种数据的上报。\n\n如果你选择了该项，那么 `Feflow` 会自动申请页面PV 的 `Monitor id`、页面 BadJS 的 `Monitor id`，然后自动生成在项目中。如此一来，项目\b便具有了这些数据上报的能力。\n\n### 接入 `Jenkins CI`\n\n最后还有一步，`Feflow` 会问你是否接入 `Jenkins CI`：\n\n![Jenkins选择](https://qpic.url.cn/feeds_pic/PiajxSqBRaELIkv2Wa0l9SxTJRTsRAq4oIt78dgcLSrK2SbsF4942HQ/)\n\n如果你选择了该项，那么每次代码提交都会在我们团队的 `Jenkins CI` 平台进行构建。\n\n现在，你的 `Feflow` 估计已经在创建项目了，你能从终端的实时日志中看到 `Feflow` 当前的状态。如果过程中还需要输入一些信息，那么按照提示输入即可。\n\n## \b开始开发\n\n项目创建好后，在项目目录下运行 `npm i` 安装好依赖，然后再运行 `npx feflow dev` 或者 `feflow dev` 就能启动本地服务，服务默认运行在 http://127.0.0.1:8001。\n\n打开 http://127.0.0.1:8001，你会看到初始态的一个页面。如果你想修改这个页面，则需要先\b大概了解一下项目的目录结构，\b知道去哪改。\n\n\b项目\b的目录结构是由你所选择的脚手架决定的，以本教程所使用的脚手架为例，生成的项目主要结构如下：\n\n```sh\n|- src\n    |- actions # 公共的 actions 目录\n    |- assets # 公共的 JS、CSS、Images \b目录\n    |- middleware # 公共的 Redux 中间件 目录\n    |- modules # 公共模块\n    |- pages # 页面目录\n        |- index # 首页\n            |- actions # 页面级的 actions 目录\n            |- assets # 页面级的 JS、CSS、Images \b目录\n            |- components # 页面级的公共组件目录\n            |- reducers # 页面级的 reducers 目录\n            |- index.html # HTML 入口\n            |- index.js # 页面 Class\n            |- index.less # pageComponent.js 中元素的样式，或者全局样式\n            |- init.js # JS 入口\n            |- pageComponent.js # React 根组件\n            |- report.js # 配合 pageComponent.js 组件的上报工具\n    |- reducers # 公共的 reducers 目录\n|- config.json\n|- feflow.json # Feflow 配置文件\n|- project.js # 项目配置文件\n```\n\n其中，`src/pages/index/index.html` 就是 `http://127.0.0.1:8001` 展示的页面。你可以打开 `src/pages/index/pageComponent.js` \b文件进行修改。\n\n## 打包构建\n\n如果你使用捷豹进行部署或者创建项目的时候自动接入 Jenkins CI，\b那么\b这一步可以直接跳过。因为捷豹会在部署前会帮我们打包构建，而 Jenkins CI 则是在我们 Git 提交\b时帮我们构建。\n\n项目开发满意后，你可能想部署到正式环境中，那么首先就得把项目代码构建成浏览器能运行的版本。\b\b运行 `npx feflow build` 或者 `felfow build` 就会在项目根目录下生成一个打包后的目录，不同脚手架、不同构建器生成的目录以及目录里面的内容都各不相同。\n\n以教程中的项目为例，运行 `feflow build` 就会生成一个 `dist` 目录，里面的目录结构如下：\n\n```sh\n|- cdn\n    |- <bizName> # 目录名根据 feflow.json 中的业务名称属性 bizName 决定，里面包含\b JS、CSS 和图片等静态资源\n        |- img # 图片资源\n|- offline\n    |- offline.zip # 离线包\n|- webserver\n    |- <bizName> # 目录名根据 feflow.json 中的业务名称属性 bizName 决定，里面包含\b了页面入口\n        |- index.html # 首页页面入口\n```\n\n你现在可以把打包后的文件部署在服务器上。\n\n## 部署\n\n### 捷豹部署\n\n使用腾讯内部的捷豹部署是我们团队\b目前的部署方式之一，这里简单做个介绍。<未完待续>\n\n### Jenkins CI\n\n捷豹\b部署仍然需要我们在捷豹系统里面操作，更自动化的方式是接入我们团队内部的 `Jenkins CI`。`Feflow` 是默认支持接入的，\b\b如果你在创建项目时选择接入了，那么这时候\b项目根目录下就会有一个 `Jenkinsfile` 文件。\n\n默认情况下，项目只要提交就会触发 `Jenkins CI` 帮你构建并将打包后的文件存在 `Jenkins CI` 的\b\b机器上。如果你想同步到捷豹上，则还需要在 `Jenkinsfile` 加上\b如下配置，加的位置文件中会做提示：\n\n```sh\njbMap[<分支名，如 master>] = <捷豹单号，如 R010518>\n```\n\n一旦加上这个配置，`Jenkins CI` 服务就会将项目的\b指定分支打包出来的文件部署到捷豹上。\n\n> 自动部署到其他平台可以通过编写自己的脚手架来实现，上述都是教程中所使用的脚手架的功能。\n\n## 发布\n\n### ARS 发布\n\n<未完待续>\n\n### 织云发布\n\n<未完待续>","source":"zh-cn/docs/start-from-zero.md","raw":"title: 开始\n---\n\n本教程适用于任何人，如果你需要快速用 `Feflow` 来开发，那么请看[快速开始](./index.md)\n\nFeflow 是一个前端工程化工具，它能轻易地帮你完成从项目创建、开发、构建到发布的所有流程，这么说可能还是不明白，下面让我们通过几分钟的例子来亲自感受一下。\n\n## 安装 Feflow\n\n\b`Feflow` 支持 Node 6.0 以上的版本，你可以使用以下命令来安装：\n\n```sh\nnpm i feflow-cli -g\n# or `yarn global add feflow-cli`\n```\n\n如果你是第一次安装，那么需要运行一次 `Feflow` 来初始化：\n\n```sh\nfeflow\n```\n\n这时你会看到如下界面：\n\n![Feflow初始化](https://qpic.url.cn/feeds_pic/ajNVdqHZLLBnQ35KoavYEVib5rbiahTaHy5yk9XoTAauib7EYVzbD4zlw/)\n\n这里让你填写的 npm registry 和 npm proxy 是为了让你用 `Feflow` 安装插件的时候保证网络畅通。比如说如果你的插件是在 tnpm 上，那么这里的 npm registry 要填写 http://r.tnpm.oa.com，而 npm proxy 要填写 http://r.tnpm.oa.com:80，这样一来，`Feflow` 在安装插件时，就会通过这个配置进行包的下载。\n\n如果你不小心一路回车使用了默认配置，但是你的插件的私有仓库里，那么你还可以通过以下命令来配置。以 tpm 为例：\n\n```sh\nfeflow config set registry http://r.tnpm.oa.com\nfeflow config set proxy http://r.tnpm.oa.com:80\n```\n\n> 关于 feflow config 命令的详解可以看[这里](.)\n\n为了继续本教程，请务必配置执行上述命令哦。\n\n## 安装脚手架\n\n`Feflow` 的核心部分并没有一个脚手架，脚手架都是通过插件的形式来安装的。为了简单起见，你可以先使用我们团队提供的脚手架 `[generator-now-webpack]((https://git.code.oa.com/feflow-plugin/generator-now-webpack)` 来继续这个教程。可以用如下命令安装：\n\n```sh\nfeflow install @tencent/generator-now-webpack\n```\n\n> 关于脚手架详细内容可以看[这里](.)\n\n到这里，脚手架就安装成功了，下面就可以开始创建项目了。\n\n## 创建项目\n\n> 官方教程假设你已经知道如何打开终端或者 cmd.exe，并且知道 shell 的一些初级知识，例如命令、环境变量等，以及已经在电脑上安装好了 Node v8.0 以上的版本。\n\n你可以直接运行以下命令开始项目的创建：\n\n```sh\nfeflow init\n```\n\n执行命令后，就会让你选择脚手架了。\n\n### 选择脚手架\n\n![脚手架选择](https://qpic.url.cn/feeds_pic/Q3auHgzwzM7gVx6mBUxNNFeUGVZI0RzI7hcn2za3VW7ia9B1oP2L7OQ/)\n\nFeflow 会让你从现有的脚手架中选择一个来创建项目，\b\b目前你只安装一个脚手架，所以只用选择 `基于 React + Redux + Webpack 的 web 业务开发解决方案` 就好。它是一个多页面脚手架，用它创建的项目自带 `React` 和 `Redux` 库，且使用 `Webpack` 作为构建工具。\n\n> 关于官方推荐的脚手架的详细介绍可参考[此文档](.)\n\n### 创建远程仓库\n\n选择完脚手架后，紧接着你又看到如下界面：\n\n![Git仓库创建](https://qpic.url.cn/feeds_pic/PiajxSqBRaEJyqw9knm4CLEQ4QRRbjFQZic6MXthn1acIt8Bvf0EJeDw/)\n\n是的，你没有看错，你无需在 `工蜂（git.code.oa.com）` 中创建一个仓库然后再与本地仓库关联起来，这个过程 `Feflow` 会自动帮你完成。当然，如果你已经在 `工蜂（git.code.oa.com）` 中创建了一个仓库并且克隆到了本地，你可以在这里输入 `n` 并按下回车。本教程假设你并没有一个仓库\b，所以你需要在这里输入 `y`。\n\n接下来，`Feflow` 会让你输入项目名称：\n\n![项目名称](https://qpic.url.cn/feeds_pic/PiajxSqBRaEJCIiad6HuhWfgkc9DpRnK7h95uf1hhRJicIHchdyibHwfXg/)\n\n每个团队的项目名称都需要一个规范，这样一眼就能从名称看出这是属于哪个业务、哪个平台的项目，方便项目归类和管理。但是，通常这个规范往往难以记住，特别是团队如果有新人来的时候，根本不知道有这个规范。\b`Feflow` 通过在创建项目的时候给予提示来解决这个问题。\n\n\b如上图所示，`Feflow` 团队的项目名称规范是 `业务类别-项目类型-项目名字`，你可以参考，也可以输入其他你想输入的项目名称。\n\n### 项目描述、版本号\n\b\b输完\b项目名称之后，`Feflow` 还会让你输入\b项目描述和版本号，项目描述尽可能写详细，让团队其他成员能够知道这个项目是干什么的，版本号尽可能合理，最好有团队自己的版本规范。\n\n### 接入 BadJS\n\n接下来，`Feflow` 会让你选择是否需要接入 `BadJS`。`BadJS` 是我们团队监控项目质量的系统，你可以通过它定位到项目的报错，这里推荐使用：\n\n![BadJS选择](https://qpic.url.cn/feeds_pic/PiajxSqBRaEJDTcTrNglmJFaXXtCDLlgGq6UZJTf7jrtAmIbRBQM3hA/)\n\n一旦你确认选择之后，`Feflow` 会自动去申请 `BadJS ID`，并填充到生成的项目里面，这样一来，就省去了人工的步骤，同时又让项目有了质量保障。\n\n> 关于如何使用 `BadJS` 来管理项目的质量请看[这篇文章](.)\n\n### \b申请离线包 ID\n\n让我们继续走下去，下一步 `Feflow` 会让你选择是否自动申请离线包 ID：\n\n![离线包选择](https://qpic.url.cn/feeds_pic/ajNVdqHZLLCKwy1cT4Tr3Z1wovA8Vzh2qATlnCHmEsGNX3Qpo89Y9w/)\n\n> 离线包是我们团队提高页面加载速度的\b\b\b方案之一，简单地来说，它会将 `HTML`、`JS`、`CSS` 等静态文件存储在用户的设备上，下次打开页面时，会直接读取\b设备上的资源。当然，如果页面有更新，那么新的离线包会被下载下来，等到用户下次进页面时，就会启用新的离线包。而离线包 ID 则是离线包的唯一标识，能让页面下载指定的离线包。\n>\n> 关于离线包的详情可参考[这篇文章](.)\n\n如果你考虑在项目中使用我们的离线包方案，那么就需要确认选择该项，这样的话 `Feflow` 就会自动\b申请 `离线包 ID` 并填充到生成的项目中，让页面有了使用离线包的能力。\n\n### 申请 `Monitor id`\n\n接下来，`Feflow` 会让你选择\b自动申请 `Monitor id`：\n\n![MonitorId选择](https://qpic.url.cn/feeds_pic/ajNVdqHZLLBGx7WlUpaTpjSmwUqzPXgnWV7saiaTWjApBicTMBcxe2mg/)\n\n> Monitor 是我们团队的数据监控系统，\b像页面PV、接口异常等都会上报到该系统，然后你就能在该系统上看到这些数据有多大的量，可以帮助发现\b业务的异常，也可以帮助知道业务的\b各种指标等。而一个 `Monitor id` 就对应着一种数据的上报。\n\n如果你选择了该项，那么 `Feflow` 会自动申请页面PV 的 `Monitor id`、页面 BadJS 的 `Monitor id`，然后自动生成在项目中。如此一来，项目\b便具有了这些数据上报的能力。\n\n### 接入 `Jenkins CI`\n\n最后还有一步，`Feflow` 会问你是否接入 `Jenkins CI`：\n\n![Jenkins选择](https://qpic.url.cn/feeds_pic/PiajxSqBRaELIkv2Wa0l9SxTJRTsRAq4oIt78dgcLSrK2SbsF4942HQ/)\n\n如果你选择了该项，那么每次代码提交都会在我们团队的 `Jenkins CI` 平台进行构建。\n\n现在，你的 `Feflow` 估计已经在创建项目了，你能从终端的实时日志中看到 `Feflow` 当前的状态。如果过程中还需要输入一些信息，那么按照提示输入即可。\n\n## \b开始开发\n\n项目创建好后，在项目目录下运行 `npm i` 安装好依赖，然后再运行 `npx feflow dev` 或者 `feflow dev` 就能启动本地服务，服务默认运行在 http://127.0.0.1:8001。\n\n打开 http://127.0.0.1:8001，你会看到初始态的一个页面。如果你想修改这个页面，则需要先\b大概了解一下项目的目录结构，\b知道去哪改。\n\n\b项目\b的目录结构是由你所选择的脚手架决定的，以本教程所使用的脚手架为例，生成的项目主要结构如下：\n\n```sh\n|- src\n    |- actions # 公共的 actions 目录\n    |- assets # 公共的

index.less # pageComponent.js 中元素的样式，或者全局样式\n            |- init.js # JS 入口\n            |- pageComponent.js # React 根组件\n            |- report.js # 配合 pageComponent.js 组件的上报工具\n    |- reducers # 公共的 reducers 目录\n|- config.json\n|- feflow.json # Feflow 配置文件\n|- project.js # 项目配置文件\n```\n\n其中，`src/pages/index/index.html` 就是 `http://127.0.0.1:8001` 展示的页面。你可以打开 `src/pages/index/pageComponent.js`

<code>src/pages/index/pageComponent.js</code> \b文件进行修改。</p>\n<h2 id=\"打包构建\"><a href=\"#打包构建\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"打包构建\"></a>打包构建</h2><p>如果你使用捷豹进行部署或者创建项目的时候自动接入 Jenkins CI，\b那么\b这一步可以直接跳过。因为捷豹会在部署前会帮我们打包构建，而 Jenkins CI 则是在我们 Git 提交\b时帮我们构建。</p>\n<p>项目开发满意后，你可能想部署到正式环境中，那么首先就得把项目代码构建成浏览器能运行的版本。\b\b运行 <code>npx feflow build</code> 或者 <code>felfow build</code> 就会在项目根目录下生成一个打包后的目录，不同脚手架、不同构建器生成的目录以及目录里面的内容都各不相同。</p>\n<p>以教程中的项目为例，运行 <code>feflow build</code> 就会生成一个 <code>dist</code> 目录，里面的目录结构如下：</p>\n<figure class=\"highlight sh\"><table><tr><td class=\"code\"><pre><span class=\"line\">|- cdn</span><br><span class=\"line\">    |- &lt;bizName&gt; <span class=\"comment\"># 目录名根据 feflow.json 中的业务名称属性 bizName 决定，里面包含\b JS、CSS

决定，里面包含\b了页面入口</span></span><br><span class=\"line\">        |- index.html <span class=\"comment\"># 首页页面入口</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>\n<p>你现在可以把打包后的文件部署在服务器上。</p>\n<h2

CI</h3><p>捷豹\b部署仍然需要我们在捷豹系统里面操作，更自动化的方式是接入我们团队内部的 <code>Jenkins CI</code>。<code>Feflow</code> 是默认支持接入的，\b\b如果你在创建项目时选择接入了，那么这时候\b项目根目录下就会有一个 <code>Jenkinsfile</code> 文件。</p>\n<p>默认情况下，项目只要提交就会触发 <code>Jenkins CI</code> 帮你构建并将打包后的文件存在 <code>Jenkins CI</code> 的\b\b机器上。如果你想同步到捷豹上，则还需要在 <code>Jenkinsfile</code> 加上\b如下配置，加的位置文件中会做提示：</p>\n<figure class=\"highlight sh\"><table><tr><td class=\"code\"><pre><span class=\"line\">jbMap[&lt;分支名，如 master&gt;] = &lt;捷豹单号，如 R010518&gt;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>\n<p>一旦加上这个配置，<code>Jenkins CI</code> 服务就会将项目的\b指定分支打包出来的文件部署到捷豹上。</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>自动部署到其他平台可以通过编写自己的脚手架来实现，上述都是教程中所使用的脚手架的功能。</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"发布\"><a href=\"#发布\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"发布\"></a>发布</h2><h3

<code>Feflow</code> 来开发，那么请看<a href=\"./index.md\">快速开始</a></p>\n<p>Feflow 是一个前端工程化工具，它能轻易地帮你完成从项目创建、开发、构建到发布的所有流程，这么说可能还是不明白，下面让我们通过几分钟的例子来亲自感受一下。</p>\n<h2 id=\"安装-Feflow\"><a href=\"#安装-Feflow\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"安装 Feflow\"></a>安装 Feflow</h2><p>\b<code>Feflow</code> 支持 Node 6.0 以上的版本，你可以使用以下命令来安装：</p>\n<figure class=\"highlight sh\"><table><tr><td class=\"code\"><pre><span class=\"line\">npm i feflow-cli -g</span><br><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"comment\"># or `yarn global add feflow-cli`</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>\n<p>如果你是第一次安装，那么需要运行一次 <code>Feflow</code> 来初始化：</p>\n<figure class=\"highlight sh\"><table><tr><td class=\"code\"><pre><span class=\"line\">feflow</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>\n<p>这时你会看到如下界面：</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://qpic.url.cn/feeds_pic/ajNVdqHZLLBnQ35KoavYEVib5rbiahTaHy5yk9XoTAauib7EYVzbD4zlw/\" alt=\"Feflow初始化\"></p>\n<p>这里让你填写的 npm registry 和 npm proxy 是为了让你用 <code>Feflow</code> 安装插件的时候保证网络畅通。比如说如果你的插件是在 tnpm 上，那么这里的 npm registry 要填写 <a href=\"http://r.tnpm.oa.com，而\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">http://r.tnpm.oa.com，而</a> npm proxy 要填写 <a href=\"http://r.tnpm.oa.com:80，这样一来，`Feflow`\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">http://r.tnpm.oa.com:80，这样一来，`Feflow`</a> 在安装插件时，就会通过这个配置进行包的下载。</p>\n<p>如果你不小心一路回车使用了默认配置，但是你的插件的私有仓库里，那么你还可以通过以下命令来配置。以 tpm 为例：</p>\n<figure class=\"highlight sh\"><table><tr><td class=\"code\"><pre><span class=\"line\">feflow config <span class=\"built_in\">set</span> registry http://r.tnpm.oa.com</span><br><span class=\"line\">feflow config <span class=\"built_in\">set</span> proxy http://r.tnpm.oa.com:80</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>\n<blockquote>\n<p>关于 feflow config 命令的详解可以看<a href=\".\">这里</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>为了继续本教程，请务必配置执行上述命令哦。</p>\n<h2 id=\"安装脚手架\"><a href=\"#安装脚手架\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"安装脚手架\"></a>安装脚手架</h2><p><code>Feflow</code> 的核心部分并没有一个脚手架，脚手架都是通过插件的形式来安装的。为了简单起见，你可以先使用我们团队提供的脚手架 <code>[generator-now-webpack]((https://git.code.oa.com/feflow-plugin/generator-now-webpack)</code> 来继续这个教程。可以用如下命令安装：</p>\n<figure class=\"highlight sh\"><table><tr><td class=\"code\"><pre><span class=\"line\">feflow install @tencent/generator-now-webpack</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>\n<blockquote>\n<p>关于脚手架详细内容可以看<a href=\".\">这里</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>到这里，脚手架就安装成功了，下面就可以开始创建项目了。</p>\n<h2 id=\"创建项目\"><a href=\"#创建项目\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"创建项目\"></a>创建项目</h2><blockquote>\n<p>官方教程假设你已经知道如何打开终端或者 cmd.exe，并且知道 shell 的一些初级知识，例如命令、环境变量等，以及已经在电脑上安装好了 Node v8.0 以上的版本。</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>你可以直接运行以下命令开始项目的创建：</p>\n<figure class=\"highlight sh\"><table><tr><td class=\"code\"><pre><span class=\"line\">feflow init</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>\n<p>执行命令后，就会让你选择脚手架了。</p>\n<h3 id=\"选择脚手架\"><a href=\"#选择脚手架\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"选择脚手架\"></a>选择脚手架</h3><p><img src=\"https://qpic.url.cn/feeds_pic/Q3auHgzwzM7gVx6mBUxNNFeUGVZI0RzI7hcn2za3VW7ia9B1oP2L7OQ/\" alt=\"脚手架选择\"></p>\n<p>Feflow 会让你从现有的脚手架中选择一个来创建项目，\b\b目前你只安装一个脚手架，所以只用选择 <code>基于 React + Redux + Webpack 的 web 业务开发解决方案</code> 就好。它是一个多页面脚手架，用它创建的项目自带 <code>React</code> 和 <code>Redux</code> 库，且使用 <code>Webpack</code> 作为构建工具。</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>关于官方推荐的脚手架的详细介绍可参考<a href=\".\">此文档</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"创建远程仓库\"><a href=\"#创建远程仓库\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"创建远程仓库\"></a>创建远程仓库</h3><p>选择完脚手架后，紧接着你又看到如下界面：</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://qpic.url.cn/feeds_pic/PiajxSqBRaEJyqw9knm4CLEQ4QRRbjFQZic6MXthn1acIt8Bvf0EJeDw/\" alt=\"Git仓库创建\"></p>\n<p>是的，你没有看错，你无需在 <code>工蜂（git.code.oa.com）</code> 中创建一个仓库然后再与本地仓库关联起来，这个过程 <code>Feflow</code> 会自动帮你完成。当然，如果你已经在 <code>工蜂（git.code.oa.com）</code> 中创建了一个仓库并且克隆到了本地，你可以在这里输入 <code>n</code> 并按下回车。本教程假设你并没有一个仓库\b，所以你需要在这里输入 <code>y</code>。</p>\n<p>接下来，<code>Feflow</code> 会让你输入项目名称：</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://qpic.url.cn/feeds_pic/PiajxSqBRaEJCIiad6HuhWfgkc9DpRnK7h95uf1hhRJicIHchdyibHwfXg/\" alt=\"项目名称\"></p>\n<p>每个团队的项目名称都需要一个规范，这样一眼就能从名称看出这是属于哪个业务、哪个平台的项目，方便项目归类和管理。但是，通常这个规范往往难以记住，特别是团队如果有新人来的时候，根本不知道有这个规范。\b<code>Feflow</code> 通过在创建项目的时候给予提示来解决这个问题。</p>\n<p>\b如上图所示，<code>Feflow</code> 团队的项目名称规范是 <code>业务类别-项目类型-项目名字</code>，你可以参考，也可以输入其他你想输入的项目名称。</p>\n<h3 id=\"项目描述、版本号\"><a href=\"#项目描述、版本号\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"项目描述、版本号\"></a>项目描述、版本号</h3><p>\b\b输完\b项目名称之后，<code>Feflow</code> 还会让你输入\b项目描述和版本号，项目描述尽可能写详细，让团队其他成员能够知道这个项目是干什么的，版本号尽可能合理，最好有团队自己的版本规范。</p>\n<h3 id=\"接入-BadJS\"><a href=\"#接入-BadJS\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"接入 BadJS\"></a>接入 BadJS</h3><p>接下来，<code>Feflow</code> 会让你选择是否需要接入 <code>BadJS</code>。<code>BadJS</code> 是我们团队监控项目质量的系统，你可以通过它定位到项目的报错，这里推荐使用：</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://qpic.url.cn/feeds_pic/PiajxSqBRaEJDTcTrNglmJFaXXtCDLlgGq6UZJTf7jrtAmIbRBQM3hA/\" alt=\"BadJS选择\"></p>\n<p>一旦你确认选择之后，<code>Feflow</code> 会自动去申请 <code>BadJS ID</code>，并填充到生成的项目里面，这样一来，就省去了人工的步骤，同时又让项目有了质量保障。</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>关于如何使用 <code>BadJS</code> 来管理项目的质量请看<a href=\".\">这篇文章</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"申请离线包-ID\"><a href=\"#申请离线包-ID\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"\b申请离线包 ID\"></a>\b申请离线包 ID</h3><p>让我们继续走下去，下一步 <code>Feflow</code> 会让你选择是否自动申请离线包 ID：</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://qpic.url.cn/feeds_pic/ajNVdqHZLLCKwy1cT4Tr3Z1wovA8Vzh2qATlnCHmEsGNX3Qpo89Y9w/\" alt=\"离线包选择\"></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>离线包是我们团队提高页面加载速度的\b\b\b方案之一，简单地来说，它会将 <code>HTML</code>、<code>JS</code>、<code>CSS</code> 等静态文件存储在用户的设备上，下次打开页面时，会直接读取\b设备上的资源。当然，如果页面有更新，那么新的离线包会被下载下来，等到用户下次进页面时，就会启用新的离线包。而离线包 ID 则是离线包的唯一标识，能让页面下载指定的离线包。</p>\n<p>关于离线包的详情可参考<a href=\".\">这篇文章</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>如果你考虑在项目中使用我们的离线包方案，那么就需要确认选择该项，这样的话 <code>Feflow</code> 就会自动\b申请 <code>离线包 ID</code> 并填充到生成的项目中，让页面有了使用离线包的能力。</p>\n<h3 id=\"申请-Monitor-id\"><a href=\"#申请-Monitor-id\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"申请 Monitor id\"></a>申请 <code>Monitor id</code></h3><p>接下来，<code>Feflow</code> 会让你选择\b自动申请 <code>Monitor id</code>：</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://qpic.url.cn/feeds_pic/ajNVdqHZLLBGx7WlUpaTpjSmwUqzPXgnWV7saiaTWjApBicTMBcxe2mg/\" alt=\"MonitorId选择\"></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Monitor 是我们团队的数据监控系统，\b像页面PV、接口异常等都会上报到该系统，然后你就能在该系统上看到这些数据有多大的量，可以帮助发现\b业务的异常，也可以帮助知道业务的\b各种指标等。而一个 <code>Monitor id</code> 就对应着一种数据的上报。</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>如果你选择了该项，那么 <code>Feflow</code> 会自动申请页面PV 的 <code>Monitor id</code>、页面 BadJS 的 <code>Monitor id</code>，然后自动生成在项目中。如此一来，项目\b便具有了这些数据上报的能力。</p>\n<h3 id=\"接入-Jenkins-CI\"><a href=\"#接入-Jenkins-CI\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"接入 Jenkins CI\"></a>接入 <code>Jenkins CI</code></h3><p>最后还有一步，<code>Feflow</code> 会问你是否接入 <code>Jenkins CI</code>：</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://qpic.url.cn/feeds_pic/PiajxSqBRaELIkv2Wa0l9SxTJRTsRAq4oIt78dgcLSrK2SbsF4942HQ/\" alt=\"Jenkins选择\"></p>\n<p>如果你选择了该项，那么每次代码提交都会在我们团队的 <code>Jenkins CI</code> 平台进行构建。</p>\n<p>现在，你的 <code>Feflow</code> 估计已经在创建项目了，你能从终端的实时日志中看到 <code>Feflow</code> 当前的状态。如果过程中还需要输入一些信息，那么按照提示输入即可。</p>\n<h2 id=\"开始开发\"><a href=\"#开始开发\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"\b开始开发\"></a>\b开始开发</h2><p>项目创建好后，在项目目录下运行 <code>npm i</code> 安装好依赖，然后再运行 <code>npx feflow dev</code> 或者 <code>feflow dev</code> 就能启动本地服务，服务默认运行在 <a href=\"http://127.0.0.1:8001。\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">http://127.0.0.1:8001。</a></p>\n<p>打开 <a href=\"http://127.0.0.1:8001，你会看到初始态的一个页面。如果你想修改这个页面，则需要先\b大概了解一下项目的目录结构，\b知道去哪改。\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">http://127.0.0.1:8001，你会看到初始态的一个页面。如果你想修改这个页面，则需要先\b大概了解一下项目的目录结构，\b知道去哪改。</a></p>\n<p>\b项目\b的目录结构是由你所选择的脚手架决定的，以本教程所使用的脚手架为例，生成的项目主要结构如下：</p>\n<figure class=\"highlight sh\"><table><tr><td class=\"code\"><pre><span class=\"line\">|- src</span><br><span class=\"line\">    |- actions <span class=\"comment\"># 公共的 actions 目录</span></span><br><span class=\"line\">    |-

<code>src/pages/index/pageComponent.js</code> \b文件进行修改。</p>\n<h2 id=\"打包构建\"><a href=\"#打包构建\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"打包构建\"></a>打包构建</h2><p>如果你使用捷豹进行部署或者创建项目的时候自动接入 Jenkins CI，\b那么\b这一步可以直接跳过。因为捷豹会在部署前会帮我们打包构建，而 Jenkins CI 则是在我们 Git 提交\b时帮我们构建。</p>\n<p>项目开发满意后，你可能想部署到正式环境中，那么首先就得把项目代码构建成浏览器能运行的版本。\b\b运行 <code>npx feflow build</code> 或者 <code>felfow build</code> 就会在项目根目录下生成一个打包后的目录，不同脚手架、不同构建器生成的目录以及目录里面的内容都各不相同。</p>\n<p>以教程中的项目为例，运行 <code>feflow build</code> 就会生成一个 <code>dist</code> 目录，里面的目录结构如下：</p>\n<figure class=\"highlight sh\"><table><tr><td class=\"code\"><pre><span class=\"line\">|- cdn</span><br><span class=\"line\">    |- &lt;bizName&gt; <span class=\"comment\"># 目录名根据 feflow.json 中的业务名称属性 bizName 决定，里面包含\b JS、CSS

决定，里面包含\b了页面入口</span></span><br><span class=\"line\">        |- index.html <span class=\"comment\"># 首页页面入口</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>\n<p>你现在可以把打包后的文件部署在服务器上。</p>\n<h2 id=\"部署\"><a href=\"#部署\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"部署\"></a>部署</h2><h3 id=\"捷豹部署\"><a href=\"#捷豹部署\" class=\"headerlink\"

CI</h3><p>捷豹\b部署仍然需要我们在捷豹系统里面操作，更自动化的方式是接入我们团队内部的 <code>Jenkins CI</code>。<code>Feflow</code> 是默认支持接入的，\b\b如果你在创建项目时选择接入了，那么这时候\b项目根目录下就会有一个 <code>Jenkinsfile</code> 文件。</p>\n<p>默认情况下，项目只要提交就会触发 <code>Jenkins CI</code> 帮你构建并将打包后的文件存在 <code>Jenkins CI</code> 的\b\b机器上。如果你想同步到捷豹上，则还需要在 <code>Jenkinsfile</code> 加上\b如下配置，加的位置文件中会做提示：</p>\n<figure class=\"highlight sh\"><table><tr><td class=\"code\"><pre><span class=\"line\">jbMap[&lt;分支名，如 master&gt;] = &lt;捷豹单号，如 R010518&gt;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>\n<p>一旦加上这个配置，<code>Jenkins CI</code> 服务就会将项目的\b指定分支打包出来的文件部署到捷豹上。</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>自动部署到其他平台可以通过编写自己的脚手架来实现，上述都是教程中所使用的脚手架的功能。</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"发布\"><a href=\"#发布\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"发布\"></a>发布</h2><h3

I'm going to introduce them below.\n\n## Fragment Caching\n\nAlthough Hexo is fast, it may become slow if you have thousands of source files or complicated categories or tags. Before the data model upgraded, I borrowed a feature from Ruby on Rails: **Fragment Caching**.\n\nFragment Caching saves contents within a fragment and serves the cache when the next request come in. A fragment will only be processed once. It can reduce database queries and decrease generation time significantly. For instance, a Hexo site with 300+ source files needs 6 minutes to generate. In Hexo 2.7, it only need 10 seconds!\n\nIt can be used in header, footer, sidebar or static contents that won't be changed during generating. For example:\n\n``` js\n<%- fragment_cache('header', function(){\n  return '<header></header>';\n}); %>\n```\n\nBy using `fragment_cache` helper, contents in the function will be cached.\n\nPartial helper also supports Fragment Caching, you only need to add a `{cache: true}` option when using partial.\n\n``` js\n<%- partial('header', {}, {cache: true}) %>\n```\n\n[Landscape] is updated and supports Fragment Caching now. You can check [this commit](https://github.com/hexojs/hexo-theme-landscape/commit/d2aedda61571d6994eb72d784ceda2f59d2a8631) to see what's changed.\n\n## Relative Link\n\nRelative Link is supported since Hexo 2.7. But your theme needs some modifications to support it. However, it's not as hard as you think. You just need to replace the following contents in templates\n\n``` js\n<%- config.root %><%- path %>\n```\n\nwith `url_for` helper.\n\n``` js\n<%- url_for(path) %>\n```\n\n`url_for` helper will add `config.root` automatically for you.

[Connect] passes a request through functions called **middleware**. You can make response to the coming in request in middleware.\n\nIn Hexo, middleware is served as a type of filter. You can add middleware by registering a new filter. For example:\n\n``` js\nhexo.extend.filter.register('server_middleware', function(app){\n  app.use(function(req, res, next){\n    res.setHeader('X-Powered-By', 'Hexo');\n    next();\n  });\n});\n```\n\nThis middleware add a header `X-Powered-By` and passes the request to the next middleware.\n\n[Landscape]: https://github.com/hexojs/hexo-theme-landscape\n[Connect]: http://www.senchalabs.org/connect/\n[Express]: http://expressjs.com/","source":"_posts/2014-06-14-hexo-2-7-released.md","raw":"title: Hexo 2.7 Released\n---\nHexo 2.7 has been released with three new features.

For example:\n\n``` js\nhexo.extend.filter.register('server_middleware', function(app){\n  app.use(function(req, res, next){\n    res.setHeader('X-Powered-By', 'Hexo');\n    next();\n  });\n});\n```\n\nThis middleware add a header `X-Powered-By` and passes the request to the next middleware.\n\n[Landscape]: https://github.com/hexojs/hexo-theme-landscape\n[Connect]: http://www.senchalabs.org/connect/\n[Express]: http://expressjs.com/","slug":"hexo-2-7-released","published":1,"date":"2014-06-14T00:00:00.000Z","updated":"2019-01-21T06:13:15.961Z","comments":1,"layout":"post","photos":[],"link":"","_id":"cjtfpzucu0001vnp8utalbq3c","content":"<p>Hexo 2.7 has been released with three new features. I’m going to introduce them below.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Fragment-Caching\"><a href=\"#Fragment-Caching\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Fragment Caching\"></a>Fragment Caching</h2><p>Although Hexo is fast, it may become slow if you have thousands of source files or complicated categories or tags. Before the data model upgraded, I borrowed a feature from Ruby on Rails: <strong>Fragment Caching</strong>.</p>\n<p>Fragment Caching saves contents within a fragment and serves the cache when the next request come in. A fragment will only be processed once. It can reduce database queries and decrease generation time significantly. For instance, a Hexo site with 300+ source files needs 6 minutes to generate. In Hexo 2.7, it only need 10 seconds!</p>\n<p>It can be used in header, footer, sidebar or static contents that won’t be changed during generating. For example:</p>\n<figure class=\"highlight js\"><table><tr><td class=\"code\"><pre><span class=\"line\">&lt;%- fragment_cache(<span class=\"string\">'header'</span>, <span class=\"function\"><span class=\"keyword\">function</span>(<span class=\"params\"></span>)</span>&#123;</span><br><span class=\"line\">  <span class=\"keyword\">return</span> <span class=\"string\">'&lt;header&gt;&lt;/header&gt;'</span>;</span><br><span class=\"line\">&#125;); %&gt;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>\n<p>By using <code>fragment_cache</code> helper, contents in the function will be cached.</p>\n<p>Partial helper also supports Fragment Caching, you only need to add a <code>{cache: true}</code> option when using partial.</p>\n<figure class=\"highlight js\"><table><tr><td class=\"code\"><pre><span class=\"line\">&lt;%- partial(<span class=\"string\">'header'</span>, &#123;&#125;, &#123;<span class=\"attr\">cache</span>: <span class=\"literal\">true</span>&#125;) %&gt;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/hexojs/hexo-theme-landscape\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Landscape</a> is updated and supports Fragment Caching now.

But your theme needs some modifications to support it. However, it’s not as hard as you think. You just need to replace the following contents in templates</p>\n<figure class=\"highlight js\"><table><tr><td class=\"code\"><pre><span class=\"line\">&lt;%- config.root %&gt;&lt;%- path %&gt;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>\n<p>with <code>url_for</code> helper.</p>\n<figure class=\"highlight js\"><table><tr><td class=\"code\"><pre><span class=\"line\">&lt;%- url_for(path) %&gt;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>\n<p><code>url_for</code> helper will add <code>config.root</code> automatically for you.

released with three new features. I’m going to introduce them below.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Fragment-Caching\"><a href=\"#Fragment-Caching\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Fragment Caching\"></a>Fragment Caching</h2><p>Although Hexo is fast, it may become slow if you have thousands of source files or complicated categories or tags. Before the data model upgraded, I borrowed a feature from Ruby on Rails: <strong>Fragment Caching</strong>.</p>\n<p>Fragment Caching saves contents within a fragment and serves the cache when the next request come in. A fragment will only be processed once. It can reduce database queries and decrease generation time significantly. For instance, a Hexo site with 300+ source files needs 6 minutes to generate.

The following is the highlights in this version. You can check [detail](https://github.com/hexojs/hexo/releases/tag/2.8.0) on GitHub.\n\n## Faster Processing Speed\n\nBefore Hexo 2.8, all source files have to be processed each time you use Hexo. In Hexo 2.8, the entire database will be saved to `db.json` so Hexo don't have to process all files again. Also, a new data type \"**skip**\" was added for processors to detect whether a file was changed or not.\n\nGenerating was also changed in Hexo 2.8. You can check the elapsed time of each file in console now. However, I found multi-process generating didn't affect generating speed a lot. Thus, `multi_thread` and `max_open_file` setting are deprecated in Hexo 2.8.\n\n{% asset_img generate-console.png %}\n\n## Draft Publish\n\nYou don't have to enter full file name to publish a post anymore. Draft publish system is rewritten in Hexo 2.8. `new_post_name` setting will be applied until drafts are published. Besides, you can choose which layout to apply when publishing.\n\n``` bash\n$ hexo publish [layout] <filename>\n```\n\nA new API `post.publish` was added to help you publish drafts more easily.\n\n``` js\nhexo.post.publish({slug: 'hello-world', layout: 'post'}, function(err, target){\n  // ...\n});\n```\n\n## Permalink\n\nFile name and permalink now share a more universal variable system. Every variables in file name can also be read in permalink. Here's a config for example:\n\n``` yaml\npermalink: :type/:title/\nnew_post_name: :type/:title.md\n```\n\nWhen you create a post, the post will be saved to `source/_posts/test/Hello-World.md` and the URL will be `http://localhost:4000/test/Hello-World/`.\n\n``` bash\n$ hexo new \"Hello World\" --type test\n```\n\n## Multi-language Support\n\nWith the new permalink introduced in the previous section, it's much easier to create a multi-language site. For example:\n\n``` yaml\npermalink: :lang/:title/\nnew_post_name: :lang/:title.md\n```\n\nThen you can create a post with `--lang` option:\n\n``` bash\n$ hexo new \"Hello World\" --lang en\n# => This post will be saved to source/_posts/en/Hello-World.md\n# => URL: http://localhost:4000/en/Hello-World/\n\n$ hexo new \"你好世界\" --lang tw\n# => This post will be saved to source/_posts/tw/你好世界.md\n# => URL: http://localhost:4000/tw/你好世界/\n```\n\nYou can define the default value of permalink variables in `permalink_defaults` setting.

brings you better performance and many improvements. The following is the highlights in this version. You can check <a href=\"https://github.com/hexojs/hexo/releases/tag/2.8.0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">detail</a> on GitHub.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Faster-Processing-Speed\"><a href=\"#Faster-Processing-Speed\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Faster Processing Speed\"></a>Faster Processing Speed</h2><p>Before Hexo 2.8, all source files have to be processed each time you use Hexo. In Hexo 2.8, the entire database will be saved to <code>db.json</code> so Hexo don’t have to process all files again. Also, a new data type “<strong>skip</strong>“ was added for processors to detect whether a file was changed or not.</p>\n<p>Generating was also changed in Hexo 2.8. You can check the elapsed time of each file in console now. However, I found multi-process generating didn’t affect generating speed a lot. Thus, <code>multi_thread</code> and <code>max_open_file</code> setting are deprecated in Hexo 2.8.</p>\n<img src=\"/news/2014/07/13/hexo-2-8-released/generate-console.png\">\n<h2 id=\"Draft-Publish\"><a href=\"#Draft-Publish\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Draft Publish\"></a>Draft Publish</h2><p>You don’t have to enter full file name to publish a post anymore. Draft publish system is rewritten in Hexo 2.8. <code>new_post_name</code> setting will be applied until drafts are published. Besides, you can choose which layout to apply when publishing.</p>\n<figure class=\"highlight bash\"><table><tr><td class=\"code\"><pre><span class=\"line\">$ hexo publish [layout] &lt;filename&gt;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>\n<p>A new API <code>post.publish</code> was added to help you publish drafts more easily.</p>\n<figure class=\"highlight js\"><table><tr><td class=\"code\"><pre><span class=\"line\">hexo.post.publish(&#123;<span class=\"attr\">slug</span>: <span class=\"string\">'hello-world'</span>, <span class=\"attr\">layout</span>: <span class=\"string\">'post'</span>&#125;, <span class=\"function\"><span class=\"keyword\">function</span>(<span class=\"params\">err, target</span>)</span>&#123;</span><br><span class=\"line\">  <span class=\"comment\">// ...</span></span><br><span class=\"line\">&#125;);</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>\n<h2 id=\"Permalink\"><a href=\"#Permalink\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Permalink\"></a>Permalink</h2><p>File name and permalink now share a more universal variable system. Every variables in file name can also be read in permalink. Here’s a config for example:</p>\n<figure class=\"highlight yaml\"><table><tr><td class=\"code\"><pre><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"attr\">permalink:</span> <span class=\"string\">:type/:title/</span></span><br><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"attr\">new_post_name:</span> <span class=\"string\">:type/:title.md</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>\n<p>When you create a post, the post will be saved to <code>source/_posts/test/Hello-World.md</code> and the URL will be <code>http://localhost:4000/test/Hello-World/</code>.</p>\n<figure class=\"highlight bash\"><table><tr><td class=\"code\"><pre><span class=\"line\">$ hexo new <span class=\"string\">\"Hello World\"</span> --<span class=\"built_in\">type</span> <span class=\"built_in\">test</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>\n<h2 id=\"Multi-language-Support\"><a href=\"#Multi-language-Support\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Multi-language Support\"></a>Multi-language Support</h2><p>With the new permalink introduced in the previous section, it’s much easier to create a multi-language site. For example:</p>\n<figure class=\"highlight yaml\"><table><tr><td class=\"code\"><pre><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"attr\">permalink:</span> <span class=\"string\">:lang/:title/</span></span><br><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"attr\">new_post_name:</span> <span class=\"string\">:lang/:title.md</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>\n<p>Then you can create a post with <code>--lang</code> option:</p>\n<figure class=\"highlight bash\"><table><tr><td class=\"code\"><pre><span class=\"line\">$ hexo new <span class=\"string\">\"Hello World\"</span> --lang en</span><br><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"comment\"># =&gt; This post will be saved to source/_posts/en/Hello-World.md</span></span><br><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"comment\"># =&gt; URL: http://localhost:4000/en/Hello-World/</span></span><br><span class=\"line\"></span><br><span class=\"line\">$ hexo new <span class=\"string\">\"你好世界\"</span> --lang tw</span><br><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"comment\"># =&gt; This post will be saved to source/_posts/tw/你好世界.md</span></span><br><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"comment\"># =&gt; URL: http://localhost:4000/tw/你好世界/</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>\n<p>You can define the default value of permalink variables in <code>permalink_defaults</code> setting. For example, we define the defualt language as English.</p>\n<figure class=\"highlight yaml\"><table><tr><td class=\"code\"><pre><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"attr\">permalink_defaults:</span></span><br><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"attr\">  lang:</span> <span class=\"string\">en</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>"},{"title":"Hexo 3.0 Released","_content":"Hexo 3.0 has finally come out!
