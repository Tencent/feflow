# Create Project

Go to the folder where you want to create the project and run `feflow init`, then you will enter the process:

![choose scaffold](https://pub.idqqimg.com/5a7071770a73496f9bfb8f00ebe0a72e.svg)

Feflow will let you choose one of the installed scaffold to create the project. Now, maybe only one scaffold installed, choose it. It's a multiple pages scaffold with React, Redux and webpack.

> Read [this](https://github.com/feflow/generator-ivweb) can get more informations about the scaffold.
